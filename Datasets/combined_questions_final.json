He also managed 427 runs with a highest score of 83.In first class matches he took to the field 436 times, scored over 12,000 runs and took 1775 wickets.The other Bob is Sir Robert Peel who served as Great Britain's Prime Minister from 1834 to 1835 and again from 1841 to 1846. He was responsible for establishing a form of police force during his tenure hence the reason why police officers in England are affectionately known as \"bobbies\".I did find record of a Robert Redford playing cricket, but only for a London social team called Drovers. There is a George Robert \"Bob\" Stephenson who kept wickets for Hampshire and Derbyshire between 1967 and 1980 and there is also a record of a Robert Frost playing one first class game for Norfolk. None of Britain's Prime Ministers, however, have been christened with these names."}, {"question": "In cricketing terms what is a leg stump?", "context": "The term 'wicket' can be very misleading in cricket. In this case it refers to the five pieces of wood which the bowler is trying to hit and the batsman is trying to defend. The three uprights are called stumps and the two shorter pieces across the top are called bails.The stump nearest the batsman's legs is called the leg stump. the one furthest away is called the off stump and the one in the middle is called (imaginatively) the middle stump. 'Wicket' can also mean the dismissal of a batsman e.g, \"The bowler has taken five wickets today\", and confusingly can also mean the 22 yard strip of pitch that most of the action takes place on.A wicket can be said to be either fast or slow depending on the speed that the ball bounces off it after hitting the surface."}, {"question": "Which of these is not a recognised fielding position?", "context": "Silly point is a catching position close to the batsman square on the offside. 'Silly' because you have to be a bit daft to field there!\r\nThe 'covers' is an area in front of square on the offside; a short extra cover fieldsman is usually put in place to deter the batsman from driving into the covers. Third man is an area behind square on the offside, usually the man at third man fields close to the boundary but cccasionally he is brought closer to the wicket, this position is known as short third man.The twelfth man is not a fielding position but is the unfortunate guy that didn't make the team on this occasion. His duties include bringing out the drinks for his teammates and running errands for the captain, it is of no consequence whether he is long or short."}, {"question": "If the fielding side believe that the batsman is out 'stumped', to whom do they make an appeal?", "context": "There are two umpires on the field of play. One stands at the bowler's end whilst the other stands square on the legside of the batsman. A stumping occurs when a batsman misses the ball and the wicket-keeper takes the bails off whilst the batsman is out of the 'crease' (a line marks the front edge of this area).The action takes place very quickly so the umpire must be aware of the situation. These days in first-class cricket umpires can refer the decision to a third umpire (who is in the pavilion) he will examine video evidence before making a decision."}, {"question": "Which of these is not something a wrist-spinner would deliver?", "context": "A 'rabbit' is a mildly derogatory term for a poor batsman, especially one who does not face fast bowling too well. A googly is a ball that is delivered in a style that suggests it will spin from leg-side to off-side, but in actual fact does the opposite. Only highly skilled bowlers can produce an effective googly, but it is a ball that can produce many wickets for the bowler.A chinaman is a googly bowled by a left handed bowler. A flipper is an off-spin delivery to which the bowler has applied backspin this makes the ball keep lower than normal."}, {"question": "What is a long-hop?", "context": "No bowler likes to send down a long hop. It is a half-paced delivery pitched short and is usually dispatched with ease by the batsman to the boundary. Bowlers who are out of practise or tired are most likely to bowl a long-hop. Strangely, the long-hop sometimes takes unmerited wickets as the batsman's eyes light up at seeing an easy ball, and he hits the ball straight to a fielder. If the bowler feels bad at sending down a long-hop, it is nothing to how the batsman feels at getting out to one! Fielding positions include long-on and long-off but not long-hop. Sounds like it might be a good name for an after game beer though."}, {"question": "What does it mean when the umpire calls \"over\"?", "context": "The bowler will bowl six balls from one end of the ground. These six balls are called an over. The umpire counts the deliveries and after six legitimate balls will call \"over\". The fielding side change positions and a different bowler starts his over from the opposite end."}, {"question": "Many cricketers have superstitions. Australians tend to be wary of the number 87 because it is 13 short of 100. English cricketers are more suspicious of the number 111. What is this number known as?", "context": "The number 111 or 'one, one, one' is known as 'Nelson' because the great English hero Nelson had only one arm, one eye and (reputedly) one of something else by the time of his death. Quite why it is considered unlucky no-one really knows. David Shepherd, the excellent English umpire, would always briefly stand on one foot whenever a player or team reached 'Nelson' or multiples of 111 to try and ward off any bad luck."}, {"question": "Which of these is not a recognised batting stroke?", "context": "A sweep is usually played against a slow bowler and involves the batsman playing a low cross-batted shot in an attempt to play the ball square or behind square on the leg-side. The hook shot is played against a fast bowler when he has sent down a short-pitched bouncer, the batsman plays the ball to leg from somewhere around shoulder height.It is a very exciting shot for spectators to watch but a high risk option for the batsman as there are usually fielders placed for the catch. The drive is a firm shot played in front of the wicket, either to off or leg.Other shots include the glance, the cut and the pull but there is no shot called the hitch."}, {"question": "What is a return crease?", "context": "Both wickets have a series of lines drawn around them. The front line is known as the batting crease (also the popping crease), and the side line is known as the return crease. When the bowler bowls a ball, he must be inside the return crease at the point of delivery."}, {"question": "What is the umpire signalling if he raises both hands above his head?", "context": "The umpire signals a boundary six by raising both hands above his head, the signal for a boundary four is a waist high sweeping of the right hand.The signal all batsmen dread is the raising of the right index finger, that means he is out. Many bowlers get disappointed when an appeal goes against them, but most realise that it is not a good idea to upset the umpire let alone threaten him with violence!"}, {"question": "Which one of these is not a way you can be out in cricket?", "context": "Although it is often a temptation to bail out when some of the faster bowlers are whizzing the ball down at 90mph or more, it has never been an official mode of dismissal in cricket.  Three of the most common ways to be dismissed are bowled, caught, and stumped."}, {"question": "On what surface is cricket traditionally played?", "context": "Cricket has always traditionally been played on a grass wicket (or strip or track as its also known), 22 yards in length, and rolled as hard as possible so that the ball bounces consistently. The outfield, usually in an oval shape, can be anything from around 60 to 120 yards distance from the wicket to the boundary.Although some wickets around the world are made of astroturf, and beach cricket is a popular, fast growing version of the traditional game. The traditional surface has always been grass."}, {"question": "How many balls or deliveries are bowled in one over?", "context": "A bowler will bowl 6 balls in succession to constitute one over. Some games are limited to a set number of overs (50 overs and increasingly, 20 overs being the more popular formats), whilst other games are played to set times, but an over still comprises of 6 legitimate balls bowled."}, {"question": "Which two countries compete for cricket's \"Ashes\"?", "context": "The first-ever Test cricket match was played between England and Australia in 1877, but it wasn't until 1882, and the 9th match played between both sides, that the concept of \"The Ashes\" was born. After suffering a damning defeat at the hands of the Australians, the England team were heavily castigated.The day after the game, a notice appeared in the obituary section of the London based paper \"The Sporting Times\", which bemoaned the death of English cricket, and stating that \"the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\". Thus was spawned one of the world's great sporting traditions."}, {"question": "If a batsman is out on the very first ball he faced, what is it called?", "context": "When a cricketer is out without scoring, it is said that he's \"out for a duck\", and if he's out on the very first ball he's faced, it then becomes a \"Golden Duck\". There are many theories abounding as to where the term \"duck\" originated, many of them highly amusing, but the accepted answer is the far more prosaic one that the figure \"0\" resembles a duck's egg. Why not an Ostrich, or an Albatross or even a Platypus' egg, I know not, but scoring a \"duck\" is something every cricketer hates.It is a character building experience."}, {"question": "What does the term \"LBW\" stand for in cricket?", "context": "The \"LBW\" law is one of the most complicated in cricket. In basic terms, if the ball hits the batsman's leg, thus stopping the ball from hitting the wicket, the bowling team can appeal to the umpire to adjudge the batsman out. However, there are many small variances on the simple theory behind the \"LBW\" dismissal."}, {"question": "Which of these is not a fielding position in cricket?", "context": "It is not a pre-requisite to have a lovely pair of pins to field at Fine Leg, but you'll probably have to do a fair amount of running if you're fielding down on the legside boundary at this position. Second Slip and Silly Mid On are both close catching positions, near to the batsman.The latter a few feet away, so you need to be a little bit silly to volunteer to go and field there. Winded Willow has nothing to do with Kenneth Grahame, cricket, or anything else."}, {"question": "What is the name given to the two people who officiate in a cricket match?", "context": "The oft maligned umpires have a very busy job of things. They must judge the legality of bowling activities, uphold the laws and spirit of the game, respond to appeals for the dismissal of the batsman, count the number of deliveries bowled, signal runs and wickets to the scorers, and countless other minute activities to ensure that the game runs smoothly.The introduction of a \"third umpire\" in recent years in most \"high profile\" games, essentially to rule on television replays, has in reality probably put even more pressure on the poor umpires to be flawless in their decision making."}, {"question": "Which colour of cricket ball has not been used in an official cricket match?", "context": "Traditionally, a cricket ball's outer casing has been made of leather, dyed red. In recent years though, with the introduction of coloured clothing into some forms of cricket, a white ball has been used for better visibility against darker clothing, and against the night sky in floodlit matches. White balls lose their colour easily though, and therefore in 2008, experimentation had been made with a light pink cricket ball in England.It remains to be seen whether this experiment will be more broadly adopted.A green ball is unlikely to be tried though, unless a way of changing the colour of grass is found of course."}, {"question": "Cricket has three basic types of bowlers; fast bowlers who use pace as their main weapon, seamers or swing bowlers who use movement of the ball to dislodge batsmen, and spinners, who use flight, guile, and the spin of the ball off the pitch. Which one of these is not a type of spin bowling seen on cricket pitches over the years?", "context": "The \"Googly\", the \"Chinaman\", and the \"Doosra\" are all specific types of spin seen fairly regularly on cricket pitches over the years. There is no spin ball called the \"Garryowen\". That's predominantly a rugby term, when the ball is kicked high into the air."}, {"question": "A is for Ashes. The test matches played between two nations are referred to as The Ashes. Which are these two teams?", "context": "The test series played between England and Australia is referred to as 'the Ashes'. When Australia first beat England in 1882, the frustrated English supporters burnt the bails and stored the ashes in an urn. A replica of this urn is awarded to the winning team whenever these two countries play test cricket."}, {"question": "B is for Bails, as essential as the stumps, bat and ball. How many bails are required to be used in a game of cricket?", "context": "A minimum of four bails are required in a game of cricket. Two bails are placed over the three stumps. And since there are two sets of stumps (batsman's end and bowler's end), a total of four bails are required. Of course, the laws prescribe that in a very windy day, the umpire may dispense with the bails. But this happens very rarely."}, {"question": "C is for Chin music. What is chin music in cricket?", "context": "Bowling bouncers or deliveries that are aimed at chin height is called 'chin music'. When a batsman receives a bouncer, he may have to jump around to avoid being hit, this is referred to as chin music. It was popularized by the West Indian fast bowlers, who were known for bowling fearsome bouncers."}, {"question": "D is for Declare. What does it mean when a captain declares?", "context": "In cricket, a game is organised into innings. In test cricket, each team has to play two innings each. An innings is closed, when all the batsmen are out. Alternately, if the captain is satisfied with the runs his team has scored, he may bring an end to the innings voluntarily. This is called declaring the inning closed or a declaration."}, {"question": "E is for Extra. Which of the following is NOT considered as an extra run in cricket?", "context": "Wides, Leg Byes, No Balls and Byes are extra runs. That is, these runs form part of the batting team's score, but are not attributed to any one batsman. A short run happens when a batsman does not ground his bat properly while running between the wickets. If this happens, one run is deducted from the batsman (and team's) score. This is not an extra."}, {"question": "F is for Flight. In cricket what does this term mean?", "context": "Flight refers to the way the delivery is bowled in the air or the trajectory of the ball. Spin bowlers depend on flight to impart spin to the ball. The higher the flight, the more chances there are of the ball spinning viciously. A ball sailing over the boundary is called a sixer."}, {"question": "G is for Groundsman. Who is a groundsman in cricket?", "context": "The groundsman of the pitch is the curator who is responsible for the maintenance of the pitch. He is the person who prepares the pitch and maintains it during the match to ensure that it does not deteriorate during the game. He is also responsible for ensuring that boundary lines, and popping crease lines are clearly drawn."}, {"question": "H is for Hawk Eye, a technology used in cricket. For what purpose is this technology used?", "context": "Hawk Eye is a technology used mainly in leg before wicket decisions. When an appeal for leg before is made, the Hawk Eye software makes a computer projection to estimate whether the ball would have hit the stumps or not. It is used by television channels.However it is not allowed to be used by the third umpire for making decisions. Incidentally, Hawk Eye is used even in tennis for line calls."}, {"question": "I is for Innings. What is the duration of an innings in a test match?", "context": "In a test match, each team has to play two innings. There is no limit to the number of overs for an innings. A team can play on till they are all out or till they are satisfied with the runs they have scored. But the longer an innings progresses, the lesser is the chance of a result. In a one day match, an innings is limited to 50 overs."}, {"question": "J is for Jab. When a batsman jabs at a ball, which of the following best describes this term?", "context": "A jab is when a batsman attempts to push a ball. Generally, when a batsman tries to play at a wide delivery he is said to be jabbing at the ball."}, {"question": "K is for Keeper.  Which of the following statements about the wicket keeper is true?", "context": "In the game of cricket, the wicket keeper is the only fielder allowed to wear gloves. No other fielder is allowed to wear gloves. However, other fielders can wear a helmet when they stand close to the stumps. Fielders are also allowed to stand behind the stumps. Also all fielders can field standing or squatting.  There is no restriction on this."}, {"question": "L is for LBW or leg before wicket. When can a batsman be NOT OUT lbw?", "context": "A batsman is out leg before wicket, if the ball pitched on a straight line between the stumps (not outside leg stump) hits his pad and in the umpire's opinion it would hit the stumps. If the batsman plays the ball or even edges it, he cannot be given out leg before the wicket. Whether the batsman plays the ball or doesn't attempt he can be given out lbw, if the umpire opines that the ball would hit the stumps. Similarly, irrespective of whether the ball hits the right or left leg, the batsman can be given out. An interesting fact is that the batsman does not have to be hit on the leg to be out leg before wicket. Sachin Tendulkar was once given out by umpire Daryl Harper off the bowling of McGrath when he ducked and was hit on the back."}, {"question": "M is for Maiden. In what context is this word used in cricket?", "context": "In cricket, if a bowler does not give away any runs in his over, then that over is described as a maiden over. In fact, bowling analysis of bowlers always shows how many maiden overs he has bowled.  A typical bowling analysis of a bowler would read like 10-3-30-2.This means the bowler has bowled 10 overs of which 3 were maidens (no runs scored), he gave away 30 runs in the other overs and took 2 wickets."}, {"question": "N is for night watchman, a term used usually in test cricket. Who is a night watchman?", "context": "In test cricket, at the end of the day's play, if a top order batsman gets out, then the captain might not want to risk sending another top order batsman to replace him. He would then send in a lower-order or tail-end batsman. The job of the tail-end batsman would be to play off the few overs remaining before the end of day's play. If he does this, he then protects the next batsman.In such a situation, the tail-end batsman is called a night watchman."}, {"question": "O is for Opener. Who is an opener in cricket?", "context": "The opening batsmen are the first two batsmen who come to bat in an innings. During the start of the innings, the ball in use is new and would help the bowler. Hence, an opener needs to be highly skilled in order to be able to face the new ball."}, {"question": "P is for Point. In what context is this term used in a cricket match?", "context": "Fielders can stand in different places in the ground of play. Each of the pre-designated places is given a particular name. For example, fielders standing behind the stumps (next to the wicket keeper) are said to be standing in 'slip' position. Similarly, 'point' refers to a fielding position that is to the off-side (left side for a right handed batsman) and square of the batsman. If the fielder in this position comes closer to the batsman, the position is called 'silly point'."}, {"question": "Q is for Quick single. What does this term mean?", "context": "A quick single is a term used to describe a quick run taken by a batsman. Many a times, even when a fielder is near the ball or when a fielder is slightly slow, the batsmen run fast and manage to get a run. Such runs taken by outwitting the fielder is referred to as quick singles."}, {"question": "R is for Retire. In a cricket match, what can this term refer to?", "context": "A batsman can retire from play. This can happen under different situations. Usually in practice or warm-up games, famous players after playing for some time leave the field or retire to give a chance to the next batsmen to get some practice. This option is available in all forms of the game, but is not usually used in International cricket as a retired batsman cannot come back.The other variant is when a batsman is hurt and leaves the field, he is known as 'retired hurt' and can come back later when he recovers."}, {"question": "S is for Sledging. What does this term refer to?", "context": "Sledging is a term used in cricket that refers to players verbally abusing each other, it may refer to light banter between players or serious exchange of foul words. Though sledging is banned, it continues unabated. In fact Australian legendary captain Steve Waugh called it 'mental disintegration' and raised sledging to new heights, using it to mentally weaken batsmen."}, {"question": "T is for Twelfth man. Who is a twelfth man in cricket?", "context": "A team comprises eleven players. But when the captain makes the list of players, he includes a twelfth name. The twelfth man cannot bat or bowl or keep wickets. But he can come as a substitute and field if any of the eleven players have to leave the field for any reason."}, {"question": "U is for Umpire. How many umpires, on and off the field,  are there usually in an International match?", "context": "Usually there are four umpires in International matches. The two main umpires are the ones who stand in the field of play and make decisions. The third umpire sits before the television set and watches replays and helps the on-field umpires when they are not sure.The fourth umpire is a reserve umpire who is available as a stand by, in case any one of the three umpires cannot participate due to any reason. In test cricket, the on-field and third umpires are neutral, that is they are from a country other than those playing the game.In one day cricket, only one on-field umpire is neutral others are usually from the host nation."}, {"question": "V in cricket is for 'the V', what does this term refer to?", "context": "In cricket, 'the V' is an area in front of the batsman, straight ahead of the batsman, covering the mid-off and mid-on fielding areas in the form of the letter V. If a batsman has to play the ball in this area, he has to play with a straight bat, which is not so easy. Orthodox cricket pundits consider a batsman good, if he plays more strokes in the V area."}, {"question": "W is for Walk. What does this term mean in the context of a batsman in cricket?", "context": "In the game of cricket, unless the dismissal is straight forward (bowled or a clean catch), a batsman has to be given out by the umpire, before he leaves the field. But there are number of batsmen (notably Adam Gilchrist of Australia) who do not wait for the umpire's decision. If they know that they are out, they walk or leave the field without waiting for the umpire to make a decision.There have been instances when the umpire ruled a batsman not out, but the batsman walked without even looking at the umpire to see his decision."}, {"question": "No X; Y is for Yard, which a yardstick for measurement in cricket. How many yards is the pitch used on the cricket field?", "context": "A game of cricket is played on a pitch, which is specially prepared by the groundsman. The pitch is rectangular in shape and all bowlers have to bowl on the pitch. The length of the pitch is fixed at 22 yards and is followed for all forms of the game of cricket."}, {"question": "Z is for Zero. When a batsman gets out for zero, which of the following terms is used to describe his innings?", "context": "A batsman who scored no runs (zero) is said to have scored a duck. The term arose because the zero looked like a duck's egg. It became popular after television channels started showed a cartoon duck weeping and leaving the field along with the batsman who scored zero. Donkey drop, chinaman and zooter are types of deliveries bowled by a bowler."}, {"question": "Every bowler wants to see one of the bails (even better, one of the stumps) flying through the air after the ball has been delivered, without involving the assistance of any other members of the fielding team.  In what way is the batter described as being dismissed when this occurs?", "context": "The wicket consists of three stumps (vertical sticks) with two bails (smaller horizontal pieces of wood) resting in grooves on top of the stumps.  The bowler's ideal is to hit the wicket so hard that the stumps are dislodged from the ground, and cartwheel through the air.   If the ball hits the wicket without the batsman having hit it, and at least one bail is dislodged, the batsman is out \"bowled\".  If the ball hits the wicket without making a bail actually fall, the batsman is \"not out\".   If the batsman manages to hit the ball, but deflects it onto the wicket, he is still out bowled."}, {"question": "One of the most common modes of dismissal for a batsman in cricket is to have hit the ball into the air, and have it caught by a fielder before it hits the ground.   When this happens, how is the batsman said to have been dismissed?", "context": "For the batsman to be out \"caught\", he must have hit the ball with his bat or with his hand (including the batting glove) while holding the bat, and the ball must be caught before it has touched the ground.  Batsmen playing a defensive stroke often try to hit the ball down into the ground near their feet, to avoid being caught.  Fielders close to the wicket can often be seen making spectacular leaps through the air in an attempt to catch the ball."}, {"question": "The batsman in cricket attempts to keep the ball from hitting the wicket in front of which he is standing.  If he uses his body (usually the protective pads on his legs) rather than his bat to do this, he may be judged out in what way?", "context": "\"Leg before wicket\" (abbreviated lbw)  is one of the most furiously debated modes of dismissal - appeals are frequent, but the dismissal depends on a number of umpire judgments, and often incurs lengthy disagreement from spectators.  These have been reduced somewhat in recent times by the use of video evidence to show whether the umpire made the correct decision regarding the critical aspects of the decision, but even video evidence is sometimes inconclusive, and the umpire's judgment has to be supported."}, {"question": "A batsman may be declared \"run out\" if a member of the fielding team dislodges a bail with the ball while the batsman is out of his ground.  Which of the two batsmen on the field at any time can be declared out this way?", "context": "Once the ball has been hit (or missed by a fielder), the two batsmen attempt to run to each others' end of the pitch.  If a bail is dislodged from either end before the runner going to that end gets there, that batsman is run out.One of the most controversial, and unusual, forms of run out is the 'mankad', named after the first player to effect it.  In 1947 the Indian bowler Vinoo Mankad ran out Australian non-striking batsman Bill Brown at the bowler's end.  Brown had advanced well down the pitch, shortening the distance he would have to run to reach the other end, and was outside his safe ground as Mankad came up to deliver the ball.  Instead of bowling it, he threw it at the stumps where he was, appealed for a run out, and was awarded the decision.  This has happened a handful of times in international competition since then, however the Laws were changed in 2000 and now the 'Mankad is not a valid form of dismissal."}, {"question": "A batsman is declared out \"stumped\", because the bails were removed while he was out of his safe ground after moving forward to play a ball which he missed.  Which member of the fielding team was responsible for removing the bails?", "context": "If the wicket keeper removes the bails while the batsman is out of his ground, and he is not attempting a run, the mode of dismissal is \"stumped\" rather than \"run out\".  This most often occurs when a spinner is bowling, and the batsmen are moving up the wicket while the ball is in flight, intending to produce a stroke that will send the ball to the boundary.  If he misses, he is vulnerable to being stumped."}, {"question": "A batsman loses his balance, and his cap falls onto his wicket, causing one of the bails to fall off.  Although the fielding team had no responsibility for this, the umpire will declare the batsman out.  What mode of dismissal will go on his record?", "context": "A batsman is out \"hit wicket' if he dislodges one or both bails with his bat, person, clothing or equipment in the act of receiving a ball, or in setting off for his first run having just received a ball.  It is always a very disconsolate batsman who leaves the field after such an incident!"}, {"question": "Another unlucky batsman has mis-hit the ball, and it is bouncing around near his feet.  He extends his bat to hit the ball further away, and sets off for a run.  When the fielding team appeals, how will the umpire rule the batsman out?", "context": "The batsman is allowed to hit the ball a second time, if it is in defense of his wicket. He is not, however, allowed to deliberately knock the ball away and attempt to score runs from it. This also counts if it has come off his pad or body first, and then he knocks it away and attempts to run."}, {"question": "When players are scrambling for a run, there may be several members of the fielding team in the same area as the two runners.  If a batsman deliberately runs between a fielder and the ball, or makes contact with the ball so as to prevent a fielded ball from hitting the stumps, he will be out.  What will the record books say beside his name in the scorecard for the match?", "context": "This is another unusual form of dismissal, but it has happened at international level. The Pakistani player  Rameez Raja was the first batsman to be dismissed \"obstructed the field\" in a 50-over-a-side international match (ODI) when he hit the ball with his bat to avoid being run out while attempting a second run in an effort to score a century (100 runs) on the final ball of the match.India's Mohinder Amarnath became the second player to be dismissed for \"obstructing the field\" in an ODI when he kicked a ball away from the bowler to avoid being run out."}, {"question": "In a match between Pakistan and Australia, Australian batsman Andrew Hilditch picked up the ball that had been returned from the outfield.  He  tossed it to the bowler, Sarfraz Nawaz.  This unthinking act of courtesy caused his dismissal when the bowler appealed, as he had breached one of the rules of the game.  How was he judged to have been dismissed?", "context": "According to the Laws of cricket, a batsman must not deliberately touch the ball with his hand.  If his hand is holding the bat at the time of contact, the hand is deemed to be part of the bat, and he can be caught by a member of the fielding team.  But if he removes the hand from the bat and it touches the ball, he may be given out \"handled the ball\"."}, {"question": "One of the rarest ways in which a batsman can be judged out in cricket is \"timed out\".  What did the batsman do wrong when he is dismissed \"timed out\"?", "context": "There is a set time allowed between batsmen - when a player is out, the next to go in must be in the centre and ready to bat within the stipulated time.  Depending on the form of the game (Test, ODI, T20 or a domestic competition) this may be between 90 seconds and 3 minutes.  The next batsman is usually required to have his batting pads on, and be ready to sprint out immediately on the fall of the wicket.In 1919 A. E. Street, the last batsman for the English county team of Somerset, was timed out in a match against Sussex with the scores level.  The match was tied, a very unusual result in cricket."}, {"question": "If a bowler bowls an unplayable ball at the batsman, it is often described as what sort of a fruity ball?", "context": "No one is quite sure where the term \"Jaffa\" comes from. Even the BBC Website ran a quest to find its origins a few years back, and no definitive answer was agreed upon. The most favoured explanation is that \"Jaffa\" is related to the Hebrew word for \"Beauty\", though no one has been able to pin down the Hebrew speaking player or spectator who first applied the term to an unplayable, \"beauty\" of a ball.My huge thanks to Player Gentlegiant17, who has offered the following, more comprehensive background to the Hebrew origins of the word. He writes; \"The Hebrew word for \"beautiful (female)\" is \"yafa\" (pronounced \"ya-fa\"), and \"beauty\" is \"yofi\" (\"yo-fi\") which is in the vicinity of \"Jaffa\" but not exactly. There is no Hebrew word \"Jaffa\" as such, \"ya-fo\", the adjacent city to Tel Aviv, called \"Jaffa\" in English and the most common citing of it which you are probabaly already aware of is with relation to the exported oranges (\"Jaffa oranges\"). The Jaffa orange (called here \"shamouti\") was cultivated here since the 19th century, and considered a high-quality species (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_orange). Could it be that the origin of the cricket term relates to the orange brand?\""}, {"question": "If a bowler is described as \"bowling chinamen\", what is the most likely explanation for this?", "context": "An orthodox left arm spinner will turn the ball from right to left. However, if a left arm bowler turns the ball in the opposite direction (ie. from left to right), it is described as \"bowling a chinaman\". It's highly likely that the term derived from the bowling of the former West Indian left arm spinner EE Achong, who was of Chinese lineage."}, {"question": "If a bowler is said to have \"bowled a maiden over\", what has he just done?", "context": "The rather prosaic explanation given for this particular cricket saying is that six balls, or an over, that concedes no runs is an \"unblemished\" over. Hence the use of the term \"maiden\"."}, {"question": "If one team is said to be \"following on\" in cricket, what is actually happening?", "context": "Cricket's Law 13 states the following; \"1. Lead on first innings(a) In a two innings match of 5 days or more, the side which bats first and leads by at least 200 runs shall have the option of requiring the other side to follow their innings.\" This option reduces depending on the amount of days set aside for the game, with the margin of lead reducing accordingly."}, {"question": "If the bowler is said to have \"Taken a Pfeiffer\", what has he done?", "context": "It is not known if this phrase was used prior to the emergence of Michelle Pfeiffer as an internationally renowned actress or not. To the best of my knowledge, she has no particular interest in cricket, but her surname does lend itself beautifully to a cricketing achievement."}, {"question": "If a batsman calls for his \"lid\", what is likely to be brought out for him?", "context": "Helmets only became commonplace in cricket in the 1970s, though some attempts at fashioning \"home made\" protective headgear using padded caps. Even towels wrapped around the head had been made in earlier times. Helmets are now generally used by batsman throughout the world, and they are compulsory for players under the age of 18 in many parts of the world.They are usually made of strengthened plastic, with a metal grill to cover the face."}, {"question": "If an umpire shouts \"One short\", what just happened on the cricket pitch?", "context": "Quite simply, if the batsman whilst running fails to ground his bat or any part of his body behind the front crease, he is deemed to have not completed a run properly, and the umpire will shout \"one short\" to the scorers. He will also make a signal by touching his shoulder with his hand to signify that a \"short run\" has taken place."}, {"question": "If you hear cricketers muttering about a superstition called \"The Nelson\", what are they referring to?", "context": "Nelson certainly only ended up with one arm, after losing the right arm in the Battle of Santa Cruz. He probably only had the sight of one eye, after suffering damage to the other one at the siege of Calvi, but there is no evidence whatsoever of him losing a leg. Why \"111\" has become unlucky Nelson's one arm, one eye, one leg, nobody is quite sure.It's possible that the superstition comes instead from the idea of three wickets standing with the bails removed, thus looking like the figure 111. Nelson's name somehow got included in the mix by accident. An exhaustive survey by \"The Cricketer\" magazine in the 1990s suggested that the number 111 was actually no more unlucky than any other number in cricket (apart from 0 - the most common score that a batsman gets dismissed for by far), so here is one cricketing superstition which has an extremely confusing explanation, based on very little factual evidence whatsoever."}, {"question": "In cricket, what or who is a \"Night Watchman\"?", "context": "The night watchman is a lower order batsman, usually one considered to have a decent defensive technique sent in near the end of the day's play to protect higher order batsmen from facing the closing deliveries of the day. It is a tactic used very much depending on specific circumstances, and the personnel available to the captain of the batting side."}, {"question": "What does the cricketing expression \"Nine, Ten and Jack\" refer to?", "context": "Quite simply, a cricket team has 11 players, so \"Nine, Ten and Jack\" can refer to the last three players in the batting order. However, the term \"Jack\" has broader connotations. Many believe it refers to a \"Jackrabbit\", so the person batting 11th in the order, usually the worst batsman on the team, is referred to as \"Jack\", or \"Jackrabbit\" or simply, as a bit of a \"rabbit\" when it comes to batting."}, {"question": "The bowler bowls the ball, it hits the batsman's pads, and the bowler turns to the umpire and screams something that sounds like \"Zaaaaart!\". What is he actually asking the Umpire?", "context": "Offically, under the laws of the game, the bowling team must \"appeal\" to the umpire to make a decision on whether the batsman is out or not. This appeal should be worded \"How is that?\", and the umpire then decides whether the batsman is out or not - usually in the case of an \"LBW\", but also for some catches, run outs and stumpings.\"How is that?\" has become shortened to \"Howzat?\" over the years, although to the casual listener, it probably sounds a lot more like a strangulated cry of pain - which can only be alleviated by the umpire's positive decision in his favour."}, {"question": "The bowler strides up to the wicket to bowl the ball, but his front foot lands in front of the line known as the popping crease as he delivers the ball. What words will you hear the umpire shouting at this point?", "context": "The \"no ball\" rule has changed from time to time over the years, but it is put in place essentially to ensure that the bowler bowls the ball from at least the minimum permitted distance from the batsman - taking into account the two batting creases, this is a distance of just under 20 yards in total from the point of delivery to the ball reaching the batsman, sometimes at speeds in excess of 90mph. No wonder we batsmen are often bruised all over for the majority of the cricket season."}, {"question": "The batsman hits the ball into the outfield, and considers whether he and his partner have a chance of completing a run before the fielder returns the ball. According to age old custom, what are the only three words that the batsman should choose from to \"call\" a run?", "context": "Although there is no \"law\" or \"rule\" written down anywhere about these three \"calls\", it's a tradition of cricket that these are the ONLY three words that batsmen should use to communicate with each other when calling a run. It's a \"custom\" that we coaches probably spend more time than anything else trying to drum into youngsters - and all of the false answers to this question have sadly been heard over the years, usually ending in tears - if the batsmen don't \"make their ground\" before the ball is returned, then it's highly likely one of them will be \"run out\" - and that's the end of his or her innings."}, {"question": "The batsman has seemingly completed two runs (running to one wicket, turning, then running back to the wicket he started from). However, at the completion of his running, the umpire turns to the scorers, making a signal which involves tapping his hand against his shoulder, accompanied by what shout to the scorers?", "context": "To complete a run, the batsman must put either part of his bat or part of his body over the batting crease at the end to which he is running. If he fails to do this, he has made what is known as a \"short run\", and the run isn't counted in his total. The umpire will then make the approved signal to the scorer, and he will also shout \"One short\" to accompany that signal."}, {"question": "The bowler has just bowled six consecutive legal deliveries, the final one has become \"dead\" by being gathered safely in the wicketkeeper's gloves, the batsmen have no intention of taking a run. What will you hear the umpire calling at this stage in the proceedings?", "context": "An \"over\" in cricket comprises now, almost universally, of six legal balls bowled in succession from the same \"end\" by the bowler. This has differed from country to country over the years, with anything from 4 to 8 balls being an \"over\" in different countries at different times. In season 1978/79, both Australia and New Zealand came into line with the rest of the world by reducing an over from 8 balls to 6 balls.I have heard some umpires say they can't wait to get to the pub at the end of an over, but as yet, this isn't an \"official\" cricketing call."}, {"question": "The bowler bowls, the batsman fends at the ball, it goes through to the wicketkeeper and there is an appeal to the umpire for a catch. What sound has the wicketkeeper heard?", "context": "Often, the batsman will get \"an edge\" to a ball - the edge being the very edge of the bat. If this is caught by a fielder (usually, the wicketkeeper, who stands directly behind the batsman), then the batsman will be given out \"caught\" - because he's \"snicked\" it to the keeper."}, {"question": "It's a Saturday afternoon, and the first innings has been going along for two or three hours. What welcome sound might some of the fielders hear from the pavilion?", "context": "Ah! The great British cricket tea! One of the highlights of the game for many. Imagine it - a nice refreshing cup of tea, some cool cucumber sandwiches and a lovely wedge or two of the skipper's wife's home made chocolate cake, all eaten with your friends in the tranquillity of the English countryside.It's been immortalised in literature, on celluloid and on the ether - but to really get the best of the quintessential cricketing experience, you've got to try it once at least in your lifetime - the cricket tea."}, {"question": "Whilst walking through the English countryside on a summer's evening, a familiar sound drifts over the gentle breeze to your ears. A game of cricket is taking place. What sound do you hear?", "context": "A cricket ball has been traditionally made of a cork inner encased in a leather outer, and the bat must, according to the laws of the game, be made from willow. This latter point has often been a bone of contention, with numerous manufacturers trying to \"gain an edge\" by using different materials to make bats, so if you hear anything other than the sound of leather on willow, be sure to call the Marylebone Cricket Club, or even the ICC, immediately, please!"}, {"question": "Between every ball, you hear a faint \"click\" coming from the direction of the umpire as he puts something from one hand to the other. What is unlikely to be causing that noise?", "context": "Umpires use many different ways of counting the six balls in an over, but I've never heard of anybody using sparrow's skulls to do so! Some umpires buy special glass marbles, whilst many simply find six coins in their pocket, or more likely, pick up six stones around the outfield, and generally transfer one from one hand to another after every ball has been bowled."}, {"question": "The bowler bowls the ball, and it passes a good three feet behind the batsman. The umpire turns to the scorers, with both arms extended he shouts what?", "context": "The Laws of Cricket, as published by the MCC, state Law 25 as follows;a) If the bowler bowls a ball, not being a No ball, the umpire shall adjudge it a Wide if, according to the definition in (b) below, in his opinion the ball passes wide of the striker where he is standing and would also have passed wide of him standing in a normal guard position.(b) The ball will be considered as passing wide of the striker unless it is sufficiently within his reach for him to be able to hit it with his bat by means of a normal cricket stroke.Or, in layman's terms - if it's too wide of the batsman to be hit from where he's standing, it's called a wide."}, {"question": "WG Grace was a powerful and popular English cricketer. His first class career spanned over 40 years from 1865 to 1908. His colourful cricket was not without controversy, and he would go to any lengths to win the game and promote himself. What underhanded and devious behaviour was he involved in?", "context": "Grace had Australia's Billy Midwinter kidnapped from Lord's in 1878, just as he was about to open the innings for Australia against  Middlesex. He took Midwinter to the Oval where Gloucestershire was playing, and left him there.  Grace was not above extracting extra money from tour organisers, or even throwing a match if it suited his purposes. Given the amounts of money he managed to amass while playing the game, his prophetic fears for the future of cricket were it to become wholly professional were at best hypocritical.He once refused to leave his wicket after being given out, stating, \"The spectators have come to see me bat and they are going to see me bat.\" Despite all his colourful activities which were certainly \"not cricket\", WG Grace is widely considered to be cricket's first superstar."}, {"question": "It was 1932 and England captain Douglas Jardine was determined to contain the Australian legend Donald Bradman. He teamed with quick bowler Harold Larwood and developed the fast leg theory. Bowling fast-rising balls directly at the batsman was considered most unsportsmanlike. The Australian public were up in arms, as players were injured and even hospitalised. What was the name given to this unnerving method of bowling?", "context": "In the 1932-1933 Ashes tour of Australia, Bodyline was all anyone talked about. Australians felt the English were cheating and the bowling method was \"not cricket\". Australian players were hurt, one  sustaining a fractured skull, another was struck savagely above the heart. Captain Bill Woodfull declared, \"There are two sides out there. One is trying to play cricket, the other is not. The game is too good to be spoiled. It is time some people got out of it\".England won the test series 4-1. Bodyline was outlawed and laws are still in place to prevent its return."}, {"question": "In 1947, Indian bowler Vinoo Mankad dismissed batsman Bill Brown in a manner that was considered to be \"not cricket\". What did he do that caused his name to be ignominiously enshrined in cricketing history?", "context": "As Mankad entered his delivery stride, he held onto the ball instead of bowling it. Bill Brown had already left the safety of his crease and was moving down the wicket, in anticipation of scoring a run. Mankad stopped his bowling action, turned around and whipped off the bails at the bowler's end. Brown was given out and the Australian press was baying for blood.  Mankad's controversial dismissal method has been outlawed.A bowler may not attempt to dismiss the player at the bowler's end once he has entered his delivery stride."}, {"question": "In 1977, one of cricket's best kept secrets was revealed. 35 of the world's top players were signed up to play a series of matches involving Australia's best against the \"Rest of the World\". Battle lines were drawn as players either joined the well paid \"rebels\" or stayed with the establishment to play \"real cricket\". The age of television had come to cricket. Who masterminded this coup, changing the staid face of the game forever?", "context": "Lucrative contracts for players reaching the end of their careers helped to solidify Packer's hold on the game. There was money to be made from this gentleman's game and Kerry Packer held all the cards. The rebel players were ostracised by the establishment, and from 1977 until 1979, Australia had two national teams. An agreement was finally reached in 1979, with Packer holding all the television and marketing rights. \"It's just not cricket\" didn't hold much sway in the face of big business."}, {"question": "In February 1981, Australia were playing New Zealand in a One-day International game. New Zealand needed to score six from the final ball to tie the match. This was an unlikely event given that the delivery was to be bowled to New Zealand's number ten batsman. Australia's captain Greg Chappell ordered the bowler, who just happened to be his younger brother Trevor, to bowl the final delivery. He asked that it be underarm along the ground. This ensured that a six was not scored and the New Zealand batsmen walked off the field in disgust. Who was the batsman who faced the controversial delivery?", "context": "The underarm bowling incident was a matter of huge controversy even years after the game finished. While McKechnie bore the Australian captain and his bowler no ill will, both Chappell brothers expressed remorse over the event.  Robert Muldoon, New Zealand's Prime minister at the time, was quoted as saying it was \"the most disgusting incident I can recall in the history of cricket\". Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser pronounced it, \"contrary to the traditions of the game\".  Bruce Edgar was at the non striker's end on 100 not out when the infamous ball was bowled.His is probably the most underrated and under discussed century in cricketing history.\r\nUnderarm bowling is now outlawed by the International Cricket Council as \"not within the spirit of the game\"."}, {"question": "Australia's fast bowler Dennis Lillee was a ferocious competitor in a career that was certainly not without controversy. Opening the bowling for Australia with another quick, Jeff Thomson, the pair terrorised all comers. Which infamous incident involving Lillee made headlines around the cricketing world?", "context": "In December 1979, Australia was playing the opening test against England in Perth. Lillee, batting at number nine, played with a willow bat and scored eleven runs before stumps. The next morning he appeared at the crease wielding an aluminium bat. The English players declared the bat was damaging the ball and Lillee was asked to change it.He refused and the game was stalled. Finally, Australian captain Greg Chappell made an appearance on the field to intervene. Lillee hurled his bat away in disgust, took up the willow version again and the game resumed.In the Perth match of 1981/82 test series against Pakistan, Lillee appeared to deliberately hinder Javed Miandad as he was completing a run. Miandad pushed Lillee out of his way in an effort to complete the single. Lillee immediately turned and kicked Miandad in the back of the leg with his left foot.At this point umpires intervened to separate the two volatile players.  Lillee did actually back Australia to lose in the Headingly test of 1981 (Australia lost) and more controversy swirled around the famous bowler."}, {"question": "The match-fixing scandals which emerged in the final years of the 20th century, rocked the cricketing world and saw the demise of a number of top flight cricketing careers. Almost every cricketing country was involved. Hearings were held and judgements handed down. A number of the accusations came from an Indian bookmaker who leveled match-fixing allegations at many players. This bookmaker was Mukesh Gupta.", "context": "Mukesh Gupta leveled match-fixing allegations at many famous players. Australia's Mark Waugh, Aravinda de Silva and Arjuna Ranatunga from Sri Lanka, England's Alec Stewart, former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe and Brian Lara from the West Indies were all cleared by inquiries in their own countries.The careers of South African skipper Hansie Cronje and India's Mohammad Azharuddin were ended after they were found guilty of Gupta's charges. Sadly Hansie Cronje was killed in a plane crash in 2002."}, {"question": "Much controversy has always surrounded the correct method of bowling. Laws relating to \"chucking\" rather than bowling are constantly under review. Modern technology has allowed close scrutiny and analysis of a bowler's action. While cricketers Brett Lee and Muttiah Muralitharan have had their bowling actions called into question, which Australian's career abruptly ended in 1963 when he was called for chucking?", "context": "While Brett Lee and Muttiah Muralitharan have had their actions closely studied, and have ultimately been cleared of \"chucking\" claims, Ian Meckiff was not so lucky. In the first Test against South Africa at Brisbane in 1963, he was no-balled four times by square leg umpire Colin Egar. Captain Richie Benaud removed him from the attack and it was to be Meckiff's last match for Australia.While his action was classed as simply \"not cricket\", had he been able to avail himself of modern day biomechanical analysis, his bowling action would most probably have been cleared."}, {"question": "Sledging or the exchange of disparaging remarks on the field has always been a colourful part of cricket. One of cricket's legendary batsmen was playing a county match in England and was on the receiving end of several unplayable bouncers. The bowler approached the batsman and commented \"Mate if you can't spot the ball, I'll tell you what it's like. It is red, round and weighs five and a half ounces.\"  Of course the batsman hit the next delivery right out of the park and into the river. He turned to the bowler and smiled, \"Mate you know what the ball is like. Now go and find it.\" Who was this famous player?", "context": "The incident involving the West Indies' Viv Richards is an example of humourous sledging, but exchanges can be quite hurtful and vicious. Harsh remarks about a player's family or indeed his lifestyle, have been widely reported, and only serve to bring what should be a \"gentleman's game\" into disrepute. Umpires and match referees are now invoking harsher fines and penalties in an effort to curb this practice."}, {"question": "Some cricketers have played outstanding cricket, and have demonstrated a true sense of fair play and sportsmanship at all times. In the early years of the 21st century, which Australian cricketer actually drew criticism from both players and commentators for \"walking\", after being given not out?", "context": "Ironically, in a game where the anguished cry of \"it's not cricket\" signals poor sportsmanship, Gilchrist has been roundly criticised for walking, despite the umpire's decision in his favour. In the 2003 World Cup Cricket semi-final, Adam Gilchrist faced the bowling of Aravinda De Silva.He lobbed De Silva's second delivery to wicket keeper Kumar Sangakkara, who took the catch. The Sri Lankans appealed confidently but umpire Rudi Koertzen gave Gilchrist \"not out\". Gilchrist, who later admitted he knew full well he was out, simply turned and walked back to the pavilion.His action became the focus of much heated discussion. Rather than be praised for his gutsy sportsmanship, he was ridiculed and criticised by players, sportswriters and commentators.Despite the incidents that have been recorded in this quiz, cricket has managed to retain the reputation of a fair game with fair play. The statement \"It's not cricket\" still describes an unfair action or situation.

Who is this critical participant in the game?", "context": "As the batsman stands at one end of the pitch waiting to attempt to hit the ball, all field positions are defined in relationship to him.  Leg (or on) side positions are on the same half of the field as his body, while off side positions are in the other half of the field.  This means that the names for specific spots on the ground are not fixed - the batsman will sometimes be at one end of the pitch, sometimes at the other end, which reverses on and off sides.  And a left-handed batsman stands on the other side of the stumps to bat, which again reverses the on and off sides.  Confused yet?  Wait, there's more!Throughout this quiz, all players will be referred to as 'he' because 'he/she' is awkward, and I hate using 'they' when referring to a single person, however politically correct it is becoming to do so.  This is not to ignore the many women who play cricket, and to whom all these comments equally apply."}, {"question": "Only one fielding player wears gloves, as he crouches to field near the batsman.  What is the name for his position?", "context": "The wicketkeeper must stand behind the stumps, to field the balls that the batsman misses (and sometimes those that he deflects, rather than hitting them properly).  It is up to him to decide exactly how close he will stand, and whether he is going to crouch or stand in his position; the decision is based on his judgment about how the next ball is going to be delivered.There is a position called long stop, but it is a long way behind the keeper, on or near the boundary of the field.  Catcher and shortstop are baseball positions."}, {"question": "Somebody has to get things going by delivering the ball which the batsman must keep from getting past him (if he misses and the bails are dislodged from the stumps on which they rest, he is out) and attempt to hit far enough away so he can score runs.  Who is this pivotal member of the fielding team?", "context": "A bowler must deliver the ball with an action that does not involve bending and straightening his elbow.  The ball usually bounces on the wicket before reaching the batsman, adding an extra dimension of unpredictability to its trajectory.  If the bowler's arm goes over the wicket at the non-batting end of the pitch as he delivers it, he is said to be bowling 'over the wicket'; if his bowling arm is on the far side of his body from the wicket, he is said to be bowling 'round the wicket'."}, {"question": "You often see a group of fielders standing in an arc near the wicket-keeper.  Where are these players said to be standing?", "context": "The slips cordon consists of up to 6 players standing along an arc that starts near the wicket-keeper and curves around the pitch on the off side.  The more players, the closer the arc comes to 90 degrees.  It is usual to have 2 or 3 slips - extra players are added to increase the pressure on the batsman if it is anticipated that he may nick the ball and produce a short flight that can be caught.However, this means that large areas of the field will not be protected, so the batsman can score freely if he gets the ball past the slips.  Gully players also stand on an arc, slightly further away from the pitch, and with the curve usually starting at about the angle where a 5th or 6th slip might be."}, {"question": "One of the two field umpires usually stands on an imaginary line running through the stumps at the batsman's end of the pitch, facing the batsman's rump.  Which of these fielders stands close to this umpire?", "context": "Square leg stands square of (perpendicular to) the wicket on the leg side of the field, near the square leg umpire.  Point is the corresponding position on the off side; straight hit is on the boundary at the far end of the field from the batsman; fine leg is roughly on a line that is halfway between square leg and long stop, the boundary position directly behind the batsman's end of the pitch."}, {"question": "Since there are 11 fielders, the position known as third man is somewhat puzzling for the neophyte.  Where on the field does this player stand?", "context": "The position of third man was added to the previously-established positions of point and slip in the early days of the game, hence its name.   The corresponding position on the leg side is called fine leg; a player directly opposite the slips would be at leg slip or leg gully; fielders near the bowler at the start of his run-up might be at mid-off or mid-on, depending on exactly where the bowler chooses to start."}, {"question": "As I am standing at my normal position of mid-wicket, I see the captain waving his arms to tell me that I have to move further out towards the boundary.  To what position has he moved me?", "context": "Adjustments to the basic fielding positions are described by some standard adjectives placed in front of the basic name.  'Deep' and 'long' mean further from the batsman while 'short' means closer to the batsman; 'fine' means at an angle closer to the imaginary line running between the stumps while 'wide' means at an angle further from that line."}, {"question": "I just got moved from point to backward point.  How did my position change?", "context": "Changes along imaginary circles (staying at roughly the same distance from the batsman) to fielding positions which are usually square (in line with the batsman's crease) are often described as moving the fielder to be behind that line ('backward') or in front of it ('forward').  Of course, if you move too far along the circle, you end up in another named position."}, {"question": "As I saw the wicket-keeper fetching a fielding helmet from its hidey-hole, I just knew the news was going to be bad.  In which of the following positions would I expect to need to wear a fielding helmet?", "context": "There are a number of suicidal positions so close to the batsman that the fielder is likely to get hit by the ball (and then, in theory, hold onto it) that these players use a helmet for safety.  They include silly mid-on, silly mid-off, silly point, and silly square leg (also called bat-pad).The names make it clear why it is usually the newest and/or least influential member of a team who is asked to field there!  The other three terms refer to positions near the boundary, where helmets are not necessary."}, {"question": "Although it is not an official name for a fielding position, there is one term that commentators love to use for the position on the boundary between deep mid-wicket and long on.  What is the agricultural nickname for this position?", "context": "One can only imagine the origin of this nickname - the cricket pitch in a field with cattle nearby?  It always gives the commentators a chance for a giggle."}, {"question": "The wicket-keeper is a key fielder in the game of cricket. The wicket-keeper usually stands behind the stumps. But can the wicket-keeper take his position in front of the stumps?", "context": "According to Law 40 (3) of the game, \"The wicket-keeper shall remain wholly behind the wicket at the striker's end from the moment the ball comes into play..\" The wicket-keeper has to remain behind the stumps and cannot take position before the stumps. He can come before the stumps after the delivery is bowled and either played or missed by the batsman."}, {"question": "The wicket-keeper occasionally wears a helmet, especially when a spin bowler is bowling. But who are the other fielders who are allowed to wear helmets?", "context": "Protective helmets can be used by any member of the fielding side. There is no restriction on its usage. But since wearing a helmet while fielding is cumbersome, only the wicket-keeper and close fielders, who are in danger of being hit by the ball use a helmet."}, {"question": "Which fielders can use gloves while fielding?", "context": "According to Law 41 of the game, only the wicket-keeper can wear protective equipment like gloves and leg guards. No other fielder is allowed to wear gloves."}, {"question": "An important terminology in cricket fielding is the 'off-side'. Which of the following best describes what the off-side is?", "context": "In cricket, most fielding positions are described based on the off-side and on-side. The off-side is the right side of a right handed batsman taking the strike. If the batsman is left-handed, then his left side is known as off-side. For a right handed batsman, his left side is known as the on-side or the leg-side."}, {"question": "In cricket fielding, what is the 'slip'?", "context": "'Slip' is a fielding position located next to the wicket-keeper(to the right of the wicket-keeper if the batsman is right handed). Depending on the wicket taking ability of the bowler, there may be as many as six or seven slip fielders. When the slip fielder stands to the left of the wicket-keeper (for a right handed batsman), the position is known as leg slip."}, {"question": "In cricket fielding, what is 'silly point'?", "context": "Silly is a term used to describe fielding positions very close to the batsman. For instance, silly point is close to the right side of a right-handed batsman very square (almost on the popping crease line). Qualifiers like silly, short, deep, forward, short and fine are used before a fielding position."}, {"question": "Can a fielder stand on the pitch before the bowler delivers the ball?", "context": "According to Law 41 (6), no fielder is allowed to have \"any part of his person grounded on or extended over the pitch\". So a fielder cannot take his position on the pitch. However after the ball is bowled, the fielder may move on the pitch to take a catch or field the ball."}, {"question": "There is a fielding position called 'Third Man' in cricket.", "context": "Third man is a fielding position in cricket. A fielder who is posted on the off-side behind the slip positions is referred to as third man."}, {"question": "Which of the following is a fielding position near the boundary line?", "context": "Long on is a fielding position on the on-side near the boundary line. The long on fielder is stationed to save boundaries. Leg gully is a fielder behind the batsman on the leg side and forward short leg is a fielding position very close to the right of the batsman. Cover is a fielding position on the off-side, which usually stands on the 30 yard circle."}, {"question": "In Test cricket, not more than two fielders are allowed outside the 30 yard circle during the first hour of play.", "context": "In one day cricket, there are many restrictions placed on the fielding side. One such restriction is called power play. In the power play system, during the first ten overs of a one day match not more than two fielders are allowed to stand outside the 30 yard circle.However, this rule is not applicable in test cricket. The only fielding restriction in test cricket is: Not more than two fielders (other than the wicket-keeper) are allowed to stand behind the popping crease on the leg side. This is mainly to prevent 'bodyline' or 'negative' bowling tactics."}, {"question": "Greetings from sunny West Indies! You don't expect to see serious injuries during cricket matches, especially now that players have started using helmets. However, in the ongoing test match, an Indian player was struck while batting and ended up with a fractured jaw. It didn't stop him from returning to the field to help his team draw the match though.\r\n\r\nYours Truly,\r\nThe Umpire\r\n\r\nWhich Indian spinner continued to play with a fractured jaw during the 4th test match in India's tour of West Indies in 2002?", "context": "Anil Kumble was hit on the jaw by a delivery from West Indian fast bowler, Mervyn Dillon during the first innings of the test match. Once it was discovered that he had fractured his jaw, he was scheduled to return home to India and undergo surgery. Before leaving, however, he was allowed to bowl in the final session of West Indies' second innings and ended up with a spell of 1-29 in the 14 overs that he bowled taking the prized wicket of Brian Lara."}, {"question": "Today was a sad for cricket. Sri Lanka were playing against India for a spot in the 1996 World Cup final. Upset by the poor performance of the hosts, the crowd started throwing plastic water bottles on the field. The players left the field for 20 minutes as they waited for the crowd to settle down. When they returned to play, the rioting worsened with some of the benches being set on fire. Ultimately the match was called off and awarded to Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\nYours Truly,\r\nThe Umpire\r\n\r\nIn which cricket stadium, the largest in India, was the 1996 World Cup semifinal between India and Sri Lanka held?", "context": "India was chasing a target of 252 but the entire batting order collapsed and the team was at 120 for the loss of 8 wickets when the rioting started. Unable to control the crowd, the match referee, Clive Lloyd, was forced to call off the match in the interests of player safety.In 1999, during Pakistan's tour of India, a controversial run out decision during the third test match (Indian batsman, Sachin Tendulkar, was given out despite being obstructed by Pakistani bowler, Shoaib Akhtar) again led to rioting at the Eden Gardens. At that time, the police evicted the entire crowd and the match was played to finish in front of an empty stadium.Eden Gardens is located in the city of Kolkata and is the second largest cricket stadium in the world after the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia."}, {"question": "Umpiring just became a tad easier for us with the introduction of the third umpire - an off field umpire who can use technology to determine dismissals which are close calls. This feature, introduced in the India vs South Africa test match at Durban in 1992, was the brainchild of former Sri Lankan cricketer Mahinda Wijesinghe.\r\n\r\nYours Truly,\r\nThe Umpire\r\n\r\nWhich Indian batsman was the first player to be declared out by the third umpire in international cricket?", "context": "Sachin Tendulkar was dismissed on a run out after the field umpires referred the decision to the third umpire.Apart from run outs, the third umpire may also be consulted in the case of a stumping or a low, just above the ground catch. Sometimes even close decisions regarding fours and sixes are referred to the third umpire."}, {"question": "Sledging often brings out the humourous side of the players, though sometimes it can cross the line and get abusive. During a test match in the Ashes series of 2001, one of the fielders, Mark Waugh, mocked the opposition's batsman, Jimmy Ormond, saying that there was no way he was good enough to play for his country. The quick-witted Ormond retorted saying, \"Maybe not, but at least I'm the best player in my own family.\"\r\n\r\nYours Truly,\r\nThe Umpire\r\n\r\nWhich two countries have been playing the Ashes series since the late 19th century?", "context": "Following England's defeat to Australia in a test match played at The Oval in London in 1882, a mock obituary appeared in the magazine \"Cricket: A Weekly Record of The Game\" mourning the death of England's supremacy in cricket. The trophy for the series is in the form of an urn which is reported to contain the ashes of a cricket ball, bails or stumps. The series is held alternately in Australia and the United Kingdom every two years.Mark Waugh is the twin brother of former Australian skipper, Steve Waugh."}, {"question": "The third edition of the cricket World Cup is turning out to be as entertaining as the previous two. Today's group match between Zimbabwe and India was a crucial match for both the teams who were fighting for a place in the semi finals. India were struggling at 5/17 when the Indian skipper, Kapil Dev, walked in to play an innings of a lifetime. It's a good thing I was umpiring this match or I would've never had a chance to see this spectacular knock.\r\n\r\nYours Truly,\r\nThe Umpire\r\n\r\nWhy is there no recorded footage of the Group match between India and Zimbabwe that was played at Tunbridge Wells in the 1983 World Cup?", "context": "Kapil Dev scored 175 runs from 138 balls including 16 fours and 6 sixes which at the time was the highest score obtained by an individual player in a limited overs match. The Indian manager, Mann Singh, was so superstitious that he ordered all the players in the Indian team to remain absolutely still and not move at all until Kapil's innings was over. Unfortunately for cricket fans all over the world, the crew of the BBC went on a strike that day and thus no video evidence is available of this historic match.India went on to defeat the reigning champions, West Indies, who had won both the previous World Cups to attain their first ever World Cup trophy."}, {"question": "Another World Cup and another thrilling match. England were playing South Africa in the semi finals of the 1992 World Cup in Australia. South Africa were chasing a target of 252 and required 22 runs from 13 balls when rain interrupted the match and stopped play. Once the match resumed, the 'best scoring overs' method was used to devise the revised target which turned out to be 21 runs from 1 ball leading to an anticlimactic end to an otherwise exciting encounter.\r\n\r\nYours Truly,\r\nThe Umpire\r\n\r\nWhich mathematical model was created by two English statisticians to calculate revised targets when matches are interrupted in order to avoid fiascos like the England-South Africa semifinal in the 1992 World Cup?", "context": "English statisticians, Frank Duckworth and Tony Lewis, created the Duckworth-Lewis method that was first used in 1997 in an England-Zimbabwe match. This method was formally adopted by the International Cricket Council in 2001 and can be applied to One Day International matches where each team has faced at least 20 overs."}, {"question": "Sport has often been used to build bridges between hostile nations. In the aftermath of the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai in 2008, the Indian government refused to allow the cricketers to go on their scheduled tour of Pakistan. It was then that Sri Lanka offered to play a few matches there. Unfortunately, this terrible incident brought an abrupt end to their tour.\r\n\r\nYours Truly,\r\nThe Umpire\r\n\r\nWhich of the following incidents was responsible for the abrupt end to Sri Lanka's tour of Pakistan in March 2009?", "context": "The teams were playing the second test match of the series at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. The attack took place when the Sri Lankan team was on their way to the stadium on the third day of the five day test match. Twelve gunmen fired at the bus injuring several members of the cricket team and killing eight people including two policemen and six civilians.Earlier in 2004, the New Zealand cricket team had called off their tour of Pakistan midway following a suicide bomb attack outside the Sheraton Hotel in Karachi where they were staying."}, {"question": "England's tour of Australia is turning out to be controversial because of a new tactic devised by the English team. The bowlers have started pitching the ball short causing it to rise towards the batsman's body resulting in him flicking it in the direction of the legside fielders. Unfortunately this line of bowling is quite dangerous and in the absence of protective gear can cause serious injuries to the batsman.\r\n\r\nYours Truly,\r\nThe Umpire\r\n\r\nWhat cricketing tactic was first used by the English side in their 1932-33 tour of Australia which led to the amendment of certain Laws of Cricket to protect batsmen from injury?", "context": "The 'Bodyline' tactic was especially devised by the then England captain, Douglas Jardine, to curb legendary Australian batsman, Don Bradman's, attempts at scoring. Although there were no serious injuries, Bodyline drew severe criticism from several quarters leading the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) to introduce a new rule in 1935 giving umpires the authority to intervene if they thought a bowler was targeting a batsman with the intention of causing injury."}, {"question": "Sentiments run high among supporters of opposing teams, especially when traditional rivals like India and Pakistan are playing against each other. In such scenarios, it's not uncommon for the spectators to taunt the opposition's fielders placed near the boundary line. Today, however, the Pakistani skipper got so upset with a spectator teasing him that he climbed up to the stands to beat him up.\r\n\r\nYours Truly,\r\nThe Umpire\r\n\r\nWhat nickname was commonly used to make fun of former Pakistani skipper, Inzamam Ul Haq's, girth and inability to run quickly between the wickets?", "context": "India and Pakistan were playing against each other in the Sahara Cup at Toronto, Canada (September 1997). During the second match in the five match One Day International (ODI) series, a Canadian based Indian, Shiv Kumar Thind, started taunting Haq on a megaphone by calling him 'mota aloo' (fat potato).Incensed, the skipper asked the team's 12th man, Mushtaq Ahmed, to get a cricket bat from the dressing room and then proceeded to the stands to beat up Thind before he was restrained by the security. Charges were filed and the Canadian police arrested Haq and charged him with two counts of assault and one count of assault with a deadly weapon. Haq also received a two ODI match ban from the match referee."}, {"question": "The Twenty20 format of cricket has its fair share of supporters and critics. The group match between India and Pakistan in the first Twenty20 World Cup (played in South Africa in September 2007) had a nail biting finish as the teams ended with a tie (India 9/141, Pakistan 7/141). To decide the winner, there was a bowl-out at the end of that match where five bowlers from each side took a shot at knocking down the unguarded stumps. The Indian bowlers made a clean sweep winning the bowl-out 3-0.\r\n\r\nYours Truly,\r\nThe Umpire\r\n\r\nAfter the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup, the rules were amended with the bowl-out being replaced by what other form of tie-breaker?", "context": "A Super Over, also called an Eliminator, involves a mini team of three batsmen and one bowler from each side. Each team is given one extra over to play and the team scoring maximum runs wins the match.A bowl-out was used for the first time in international cricket in a New Zealand - West Indies Twenty20 match in 2006."}, {"question": "A nice gentle start to the innings. Your batsman plays the first 4 balls back to the bowler, scoring no runs. An easy single through the covers (on the off side) off the fifth ball, and then another no scoring ball to finish off the over. How many runs in total has your team scored from the first over?", "context": "A single is one run - the batsman \"on strike\" hits the ball to the outfield, and both batsmen complete a \"run\" - running from one wicket to the wicket at the other end, and both \"making their ground\" - running the bat, or part of their body - but it's almost always the bat - past the Batting, or the Popping crease - this is the long line that runs across the pitch, approximately a metre in front of the stumps."}, {"question": "The first ball of the second over is pulled by the batsman along the ground and over the leg side boundary. The next four balls all result in no runs being scored, before the batsman scramble a couple of runs off the last ball thanks to a misfield by the fielder on the Third Man (Off side, behind the wicket) boundary. So how many runs in total off this over?", "context": "If the ball crosses the boundary having hit the infield, or rolled along it, then a four is scored. So the first ball scores four. The next four balls ad nothing to the total, and then the last ball goes for two runs to the infield - so a total of 6 runs off this over."}, {"question": "The third over of the match, and this ends up as a \"Maiden\" over - how many runs do you think were scored off this over in total?", "context": "A \"maiden\" over is an over where no runs at all are scored from the bat off the six balls. It's important to note the phrase \"from the bat\", as it's possible for a bowler to bowl a maiden over whilst the team concedes certain types of extras - leg byes and byes generally. This is still known as a maiden over, despite the fact that the team have conceded runs.The history of the term \"Maiden\" over is interesting. It would appear that the term first started as a cricketing term, before becoming more widely used as an expression meaning \"to sweep a young lady off her feet\" - certainly, there are no records of the latter use of the term pre-dating any cricketing references to the term. How it became a cricketing term is, I suspect, down to a pretty prosaic explanation - a lot more prosaic than the slightly \"Romantic\" ideal of charming a young lady to distraction!"}, {"question": "The fourth over of the innings, and a single bye is scored from the first ball - and a four from the last ball. How many team runs in total from the 4th over?", "context": "The \"bye\" is an extra - this usually occurs when a ball passes the batsman and the wicketkeeper (who stands behind the stumps the striking batsman is defending), and the two batsmen cross for a run. Sometimes this can be two or three byes run by the batsmen, and sometimes the ball will go all the way to the boundary, resulting in 4 byes being scored. \"Byes\" are not credited to the batsman, or against the bowlers - they are scored as team extras, and add to the team total."}, {"question": "OK, two singles off the first two balls of the 5th over. A four through extra cover of the third, and another four over long off from the 4th. No runs from the rest of the over - how many runs in total scored from this over?", "context": "Two singles = 2 in total. A four through extra cover is a ball hit to the offside of the batsman, at roughly a 45 degree angle in front of him. The next ball was the same result - 4 more runs - but long off is just a little bit straighter than extra cover. So two ones and two fours is 10 in total."}, {"question": "At the start of the next over, the first ball is driven by the batsman through the covers, along the ground, and across the boundary. The stroke is repeated off the next ball. The third ball goes for a single, the fourth goes through fine leg for a four, and the last two balls were \"dot balls\" - how many have you scored from the over?", "context": "If the ball crosses the boundary having hit the infield, or rolled along it, then a four is scored. There are three of these in the over, one single run, and two \"dot balls\" where no runs are scored - so a total of 13 off the over."}, {"question": "OK, it's the seventh over of the game, and your team scores the following from it- A single, a maximum, another single, two dot balls and a leg bye. How many runs has your team scored in total from the over?", "context": "A single is one run - the batsman \"on strike\" hits the ball to the outfield, and both batsmen complete a \"run\" - running from one wicket to the wicket at the other end. A \"maximum\" is a six off the bat - the most a batsman can score from a single hit.He does this by hitting the ball, without bouncing, across the boundary. If it bounces, he only gets four. Another single takes your total to 8 - then two \"dot\" balls. A \"dot ball\" is a term used to say that no runs were scored off that ball - so called because the scorer traditionally enters a \"dot\" into the scorebook to denote such a ball. Finally a leg bye is when the ball hits the batsman's leg (usually, though it can be any other part of his body), and runs are scored in the same way as if the ball had come from the bat - but the score is marked against the team, in the column called \"extras\". So a total of 9 scored by the team off this over."}, {"question": "In this over, a sudden collapse - the bowler takes a hat trick from the first three balls, then the new batsman sees out the remainder of the over without attempting any runs, and nor are any extras scored. So how many runs in total have your team scored from the 8th over?", "context": "A \"hat trick\" in cricket is a bowler taking a wicket with three consecutive balls. No runs can be scored by the batsmen off a wicket taking ball by the bowler. Three balls defended at the end of the over mean that no runs are scored at all from this over.In cricketing parlance, this is another \"maiden\" over to the bowler - but as he took three wickets in the over, it would be referred to as a \"triple wicket maiden\"."}, {"question": "Only two overs to go in the innings now - you score 4 leg byes from the first ball after the ball hits the batsman's pads, and is deflected over the boundary rope. A \"wide\" is called off the next ball, adding another run to the total, then two more boundary fours and 3 singles are scored from the rest of the over - a good over for you, because your team added how many runs?", "context": "Leg byes count towards the team total under the \"extras\" score. Two boundary 4's to the batsman and three singles add up to 15 - but you also need to add one more for the \"wide\", to give you your total of 16. A \"wide\" is when the ball is deemed by the umpire to be unreachable by the batsman from his normal stance.A run is added to the extras column, and the ball is bowled again."}, {"question": "The last over of the 10 over slog, and the batsman is really going for the big hits now - in fact, he manages to repeat a feat first accomplished by Sir Gary Sobers for Nottinghamshire in 1968, repeated by Indian Ravi Shastri in 1985, then the feat was seen twice more in 2007. How many runs from the final over?", "context": "You can see an article on Glamorgan's website celebrating the 40th anniversary of Sir Gary Sobers' feat here;http://www.glamorgancricket.com/news_view.php?news_id=1430There are also plenty of videos of the two instances of the feat in 2007 - South African Herschelle Gibbs in the World Cup, and India's Yuvraj Singh in the Twenty20 World Cup. Quite a feat - and I hope you enjoyed slogging the ball all around the ground in this quiz as well!"}, {"question": "Cricket is about hitting a ball with a bat. What material is the bat made of?", "context": "The main part of the bat has always been made of willow. These days, the handle is made of cane, spliced into the main body of the bat, and usually covered with a rubber or string \"grip\"."}, {"question": "What is a cricket ball made of?", "context": "The outside is made usually of four quarters of leather, stitched together by string. A lacquer is usually applied to this finished item. Take away the leather, and you get miles and miles of string wound around a cork core, and then a funny little soft rubbery ball right in the middle."}, {"question": "What is the name given to the person trying to hit the ball?", "context": "With the massive rise in women's and girls' cricket worldwide, it has slowly moved from \"batsman\" to \"batter\", even if this does conjure up something you get on your sausage in a chip shop."}, {"question": "What is the name of the person who delivers the ball to the batsman?", "context": "The \"chucker\" option is an interesting one. Without going too much into the technicalities of bowling, the arm needs to remain fundamentally \"straight\" throughout the bowling action. Sometimes, this \"rule\" is inadvertently, or even deliberatley broken, and the \"slang\" term for this type of bowler is a \"Chucker\", so although you may hear this term associated with bowlers, it's not an official term."}, {"question": "The batsman stands in front of something called a wicket. What is the wicket physically comprised of?", "context": "When cricket was first played, the players would grab a couple of pieces of wicket fence as the \"target\" for the bowler to aim at."}, {"question": "Approximately how many countries worldwide are affiliated to the International Cricket Conference and play the game?", "context": "There are over 100 member countries of the ICC, 10 full playing Test members, who play official Test matches against each other, 33 Associate members and 58 Affiliate members, some of the more recent members include Guernsey, Myanmar, Peru, Mexico, Swaziland, Slovenia, and Cameroon."}, {"question": "Numerous different countries have appeared in Women's Test Cricket. Many of these countries also play men's official test matches. Which country was the first to field a Women's Test match team, but not a male side in an Official Test Match?", "context": "Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, and the West Indies have all played Women's and Men's matches. Sri Lanka's Women had also played one Test match, and Ireland's Women had also played a solitary Official Women's Test against India in 2000."}, {"question": "Which one of these is a famous Test cricketer?", "context": "Sir Don Bradman was voted as the greatest cricketer of the 20th Century in a poll of fans worldwide in 2001. Born in Cootamundra, New South Wales, he played 52 tests for Australia between 1928 and 1948, averaging an amazing 99.94 runs per innings as a batsmen. Very few other batsmen have averaged over 50 in Test cricket, so Sir Don's feat is truly remarkable. Johnny Wilkinson is a rugby player, Nick Faldo a golfer, and Geoff Hurst is a footballer who once scored 3 goals for England in a World Cup Soccer Final."}, {"question": "Which of these is a famous Test cricketer?", "context": "Rachel Heyhoe-Flint was a successful batsman and captain of the England cricket team for over 20 years. When she retired from test cricket in 1979, she held the world record at the time for the highest score made by a woman in Test cricket of 179. Evonne Goolagong was an Australian tennis player of roughly the same era, Victoria Beckham is married to a famous English footballer as well as being better known as \"Posh Spice\", and Donna Bradman was just too good an opportunity to make up a name that might \"stump\" some people."}, {"question": "Which of the following books would be more useful to a cricket fan?", "context": "\"Wisden\" was first published by the cricketer John Wisden in 1864, as a reference book to \"all things cricket\". It is still published annually, and is as comprehensive a record that anyone would need of all the major contemporary cricketing data. \"The Guinness Book of Records\" probably has a handful of some of the major cricketing records, possibly half a column at most though in amongst all the other records it publishes. \"Schott's Miscellany\" probably has a couple of very obscure cricketing references in it somewhere.The closest \"Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management\" comes to cricket is probably in her recipes for Yorkshire Pudding, or how to make the \"batter\" for it."}, {"question": "Traditionally, before the advent of coloured clothing in one day cricket, both teams would wear kit of predominantly which colour?", "context": "Lots of good practical reasons for this - it's the easiest background to see a dark ball against, it's a sensible colour to wear in the sun (which is supposed to shine in the summer, when cricket is played!), and most shirts only came in white anyway in the early days of cricket."}, {"question": "What is the traditional colour of the ball in most forms of cricket?", "context": "Until recent times, with the introduction of coloured clothing and a white ball in some forms of one day cricket, all cricket balls were red. It's still the case when white clothing is used. I've never heard of a black cricket ball, a green one would be completely impractical against a background of green grass, and though pink sounds like a highly unlikely option, just watch this space - some experimentation has been done with a light pink ball, and it could be introduced to one day cricket at some stage in the future."}, {"question": "What colour are the distinctively branded bats used in all Stanford Twenty20 matches?", "context": "Sir Allen Stanford is a Texan billionaire who moved to the West Indies in the 1990's.

What is this kind of delivery known as?", "context": "The bouncer is a fast delivery pitched short and which rears up at chest or head height putting the batsman in trouble. He has to either play it, that too at an awkward height that could get him out; or the ball hits him or he has to duck to avoid the delivery.The bouncer has been used from time immemorial by fast bowlers to terrorize batsman. The bouncer can seriously hurt batsman (Former Indian opener Raman Lamba was killed when he was hit on the head by a bouncer in a local league match!); So the laws were amended to allow only 2 bouncers per over in test cricket and 1 per over in one day matches.A delivery that contravenes this law is called a no ball."}, {"question": "Leg spinner Shane Warne bowls a delivery that bowls on the off stump, the right handed batsman expects it to spin towards off and moves towards leg to make place to cut it, but the ball spins back in viciously and shatters the stumps. What is this type of delivery called?", "context": "The googly is bowled by a leg spinner from the back of his hand. The delivery seems to be spinning away from the batsman, but it spins back in quickly and if the batsman is not watchful, he can be out. This delivery was reportedly invented by an Australian spinner Bernard Bosanquet, after whom it was initially called the Bosie.

What kind of delivery is this?", "context": "The beamer is a fast-full pitched delivery. This delivery is a full toss which is usually aimed at the chest or above. Since these deliveries don't pitch (bounce off the pitch), they are extremely difficult to play and also dangerous. Therefore, beamers (any fast full toss above waist height) are not allowed in cricket. If a bowler bowls this type of a delivery, it is called a no ball.A bowler who bowls two beamers will be suspended for bowling for the rest of the innings( or match, as applicable)."}, {"question": "Leg spinner Abdul Qadir comes in and bowls a delivery that pitches and comes back lower, trapping the batsman in front of the stumps, out leg before! Which is this delivery?", "context": "The flipper is a special delivery bowled by a leg spinner. It is squeezed out of the front of the hand using the thumb and the first and second finger. The ball seems to be coming like a regular leg spinner, but the use of the thumb and finger, results in the ball coming out underneath the hand.This makes the ball come very fast and low and if the batsman goes on the back foot, he can be bowled or out leg before. Aussie leg spinner Charlie Grimmett is credited as having invented this delivery.  Shane Warne was known for his expertise in bowling the flipper."}, {"question": "McGrath comes in to bowl to a right hand batsman, he bowls one outside the off stump, the batsman leaves the ball, but the ball suddenly moves in the air and  back inside and knocks out the middle stump! Which kind of a delivery did McGrath bowl?", "context": "The in swinger is an important weapon for a seam bowler. This delivery is held with the seam of the ball in a vertical position and the first two fingers pointed towards the leg stump. When it bounces off the pitch the delivery swings or seams back into the batsman. This is the in swinger; an out swinger is a delivery that on pitching seams away from the batsman."}, {"question": "A batsman loves it when a bowler bowls a half-volley. What is a half-volley delivery in cricket?", "context": "A half-volley is a delivery that pitches just in front of the batsman's bat and just short of the block-hole position. Such a delivery would be easy for the batsman to hit and would be a gift to a good batsman. A batsman can very easily drive or flick such deliveries."}, {"question": "Imran Khan of Pakistan was an exponent of reverse swing bowling. Which of the following best describes reverse swing?", "context": "Reverse swing is the art of swinging the old ball. A new ball swings generally for 10-20 overs. A ball that is old is difficult to swing irrespective of how much it is polished. Sarfraz Nawaz of Pakistan was the first to discover the technique of reverse swing.In reverse swing, a ball that is gripped and delivered like an out swinger will on pitching come back in like an in swinger and vice-versa. This happens very late creating problems for the batsman. A requirement for reverse swing is that the ball should be bowled at a speed of around 80 miles per hour and one side needs to have become rough. Imran Khan, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis of Pakistan have been experts in the art of reverse swing."}, {"question": "One of the earliest controversies in cricket was 'Bodyline'. The English cricket team in the 1932-33 tour of Australia bowled bouncers on the leg stump, stunning the Australian batsmen and the world of cricket. Who was the mastermind of the bodyline theory?", "context": "Douglas Jardine was the captain of the English cricket team who devised the bodyline strategy. The theory was to bowl bouncers on the leg stump with a cordon of fielders on the leg side. As a result of this, the batsman had to either try to play the ball and maybe get caught, or try to evade and then maybe get hit. This was a highly successful strategy and England won the series 4-1. There were strong reactions from the Australian team and public.The laws of the game were amended in 1935, giving umpires the power to intervene if bowlers tried to deliberately injure batsmen. Subsequent amendments to the laws ensured that no more than two fielders could be placed on the leg side behind the batsman and also the number of bouncers a bowler could bowl was limited.Harold Larwood was one of the bowlers who implemented Jardine's strategy. Woodfull was the Australian captain for that series and the great Bradman was the intended target of Bodyline."}, {"question": "Racism has been an ugly word in the world of cricket. The South African government which practiced apartheid was allowed to play international cricket till the early 1970s when they were finally isolated. What event triggered this isolation?", "context": "The South African policy of apartheid resulted in most countries cutting off diplomatic ties. But South Africa continued to play international cricket till 1968. When England was scheduled to tour South Africa, the English team selected a coloured player named Basil D'Oliveira.The South African government refused to allow Basil to enter, resulting in the tour being called off. Subsequently South Africa was isolated in the cricketing world and none of the cricketing teams toured South Africa. This ban was in place for 22 years.

With the help of English skipper Tony Greig, he setup the WSC which was an instant success.The WSC introduced day/night matches, batsmen wearing helmets, coloured clothing and the white ball. The end result of WSC was that the Australian Cricket board capitulated to Packer and awarded him the exclusive rights for cricket matches in Australia."}, {"question": "In 1981, in a one day match between Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand needed a six off the last ball to tie the match. Australian skipper Greg Chappell asked the bowler to bowl an underarm delivery (along the grund) for the last ball of the match, creating a furore. Who was the bowler who bowled the infamous underarm delivery?", "context": "Brian McKechnie was the New Zealand batsman at the crease when six runs were required by New Zealand to tie the match. Greg Chappell asked his brother Trevor to bowl underarm and roll the delivery along the ground, thereby preventing the batsman from hitting a six.This incident invited widespread condemnation. This was a legal delivery because the laws of cricket at that time allowed underarm bowling, though it was considered unfair. Consequently, the laws of the game were revised and underarm bowling was banned."}, {"question": "One of the major controversies involving cricket umpires took place in the 1987 England tour of Pakistan, when umpire Shakoor Rana had an ugly on-field spat with the English cricket captain and also boycotted the match by refusing to officiate. Who was the English cricket captain involved in this controversy?", "context": "Mike Gatting was the captain of the English cricket team, which was stunned by the umpiring decisions of Shakoor Rana. Things came to a head in the Faisalabad test, when Rana and Gatting had a shouting match with fingers pointed at each other. Shakoor Rana refused to officiate in the match and Gatting was forced to apologise.As a result of this controversy, the ICC (International Cricket Council) decided to introduce neutral umpires to prevent umpiring bias. All test matches played subsequently have neutral umpires (from another cricket playing country) and one day matches have one neutral umpire and one local umpire."}, {"question": "The biggest and most shameful controversy to affect cricket has been the match-fixing controversy. In late 2000 the captains of three nations were found guilty and banned. Which was the country whose captain was NOT affected by this scandal?", "context": "The match-fixing scandal shook the world of cricket, when it was revealed that South African captain Hansie Cronje took money from bookies to fix matches.

In 1995 in the Boxing day test in Australia, he was called for throwing by an on-field umpire, creating a controversy. Who was the umpire who no-balled Murali seven times in the match for throwing?", "context": "It was umpire Darrell Hair of Australia, who no-balled Murali seven times for throwing in the 1995 test match at the MCG. This led to a debate of whether Murali was a 'chucker'. Subsequent biomechanical tests revealed that his action looked suspect because of a congenital defect in his arm. Murali was subsequently cleared by the ICC, even through the throwing controversy lingered for a very long time. Reacting to Darrell Hair's decision, the legendary Don Bradman was quoted as saying that this was the \"worst example of umpiring he witnessed and against everything that the game stood for\".In a subsequent study by the ICC, it was revealed that almost 99% of bowlers straightened their arm while bowling (the only exception was part-timer Ramnaresh Sarwan). The ICC decided to allow a latitude of 15 degree bend in the arm to bowlers during their bowling action."}, {"question": "The test match in Antigua between Australia and West Indies in 2003, witnessed an ugly on-field spat between an Australian and a West Indian. This incident shocked the cricketing world and forced the ICC to introduce a code a conduct for players. Who were the two players involved in this controversy?", "context": "In the Antigua test in 2003, Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath and West Indian batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan were involved in a sledging incident, which led to heated arguments between both players.

Who were the two umpires involved in this incident?", "context": "Umpires Darrell Hair (Australia) and Billy Doctrove (West Indies) were officiating in the fourth test between England and Pakistan held in August 2006 at the Oval. Suspecting a case of ball tampering, umpire Hair awarded five penalty runs to England. This infuriated the Pakistani players who under their captain Inzamam Ul-Haq refused to come back to the field after tea. Umpire Darrell Hair then awarded the match to England by forfeit.This led to a big controversy and the ICC under pressure from Pakistan (supported by India) sacked Hair, but did not take any action against umpire Doctrove.This led to Hair filing a case against the ICC.

Although this was at the time within the laws of the game, it caused a huge furore and a subsequent change in the Laws banning underarm bowling in One Day International matches. It was said that such an action was against the spirit of the game.Ironically, some 3 years previously in 1978, McKechnie had been involved in an equally controversial piece of unsportsmanlike play on the international sports field - but that time, it was in a different sport! In the rugby union international between Wales and New Zealand, Wales were leading 12-10 going into the final few minutes of the game. At a line out in the Welsh half, New Zeland's Andy Hayden took a dive out of a line out,conning the referee into awarding a penalty in his favour - Hayden has admitted later to the \"crime\" that millions witnessed on the day!

Who hit the winning runs (a six) for New Zealand with nine wickets down?", "context": "This group stage match between Australia and New Zealand played at Eden Park, Auckland was one of the best matches of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015. Australia won the all important toss and  chose to bat first. They were cruising along at 80 for 1 before being reduced to 95 for 4. Trent Boult then bowled one of the best spells of fast bowling in World Cup history to rip apart the Australian lower middle order and the tail to bowl out Australia for 151 runs. Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin was the sole face of resistance scoring 43 runs.Chasing 152 runs to win, Brendon McCullum began with a blitzkrieg scoring 50 runs in just 24 balls before getting out. The score read 78 for 2. Mitchell Starc, eventual man of the tournament, then bowled probably an even greater spell than that bowled by Boult. Starc picked six wickets which included ripping apart the stumps four times. The equation was brought down to six runs required with only one wicket in hand for the Kiwis. Trent Boult blocked two fast threatening yorkers from Mitchell Starc and passed on the strike to Kane Williamson who smashed a six off Pat Cummins to end the memorable match."}, {"question": "England vs. Bangladesh was one of the most historic matches of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 with Bangladesh defeating England and in the process ensuring a place in the Quarter Finals for the first time ever; and also knocking England out.

Mahmudullah scored 103 runs and Mushfiqur missed out on a century himself scoring 89 runs.England had to win this match to remain in the tournament. They started very well and reached 235 for 6 in 45 overs requiring 41 in the last five overs with Jos Buttler and Chris Woakes at the crease. Bangladesh then strangled them with some very good death over bowling to bundle them out for 260 runs for a very famous win."}, {"question": "Pakistan and Australia met in the third quarter final of the ICC Cricket World Cup at Adelaide. One of the most exciting phases of the match was Wahab Riaz's fiery spell of fast bowling to Shane Watson which almost resulted in Watson getting out but for a dropped catch.

Australia chase down the total with more than 16 overs left and with 6 wickets in hand.\"This was the end result of the third quarter final of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015. But hidden behind these lines is a story of a fast bowler bowling his very best and capturing the imagination of millions around the world. Pakistani fast bowler Wahab Riaz ended with figures of 2 for 54 in 9 overs which is not that good in a low-scoring game of cricket. But for a period of about 30-45 minutes it looked like he would take the game away from Australia.He first got the dangerous David Warner out and then Michael Clarke with a clever bouncer. This brought all-rounder Shane Watson on to the pitch. He was welcomed by a fast bouncer by Riaz warning him of what was coming in the next few overs. What followed was total domination of the batsman by the bowler. Every ball that followed was fast and shoulder level or above with occassional full pitched deliveries. Watson was jumping around fending balls away, bending to save his head, hooking balls he normally wouldn't have. He was in a total mess. And Riaz sensing this started provoking Watson after every ball to make him lose his concentration.All this resulted in Watson hooking a fast bouncer directly to the fielder at fine-leg only for it to be dropped by Rahat Ali. A great spell of fast bowling rendered useless by that dropped catch. Australia were then at 79 for 3 and that wicket would have made the game tight and who knows what might have happened. But as the history books will say, Australia won that match and eventually the tournament. What they won't say is the story of a fast bowler bowling his hearts out only to be denied by fate."}, {"question": "Two double centuries were scored in ODI cricket in the year 2015 and both by opening batsmen. Who scored them?", "context": "A decade ago, scoring a double ton in a One Day International match was unthinkable. But the advent of Twenty 20 cricket resulted in alternate batting styles with batsman playing more aggressively and scoring runs at a faster rate. The boundary lines no longer matter as balls are smashed out of the grounds for massive sixes. Fielding placements are immaterial as batsmen tend to find the gaps in more innovative ways. All in all, the level of batting has certainly increased by a few rungs.The year 2010 was a landmark year when Sachin Tendulkar scored the first ever double century in ODIs. Virender Sehwag and Rohit Sharma followed soon with 200s. Then came Rohit Sharma's mammoth 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014. All these were scored in batting-friendly conditions in India.The ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 saw mammoth scores by teams with 400 being breached multiple times. But two individual batting performances that stood out were the double centuries by Chris Gayle (215 against Zimbabwe in Canberra) and Martin Guptill (237 not out against West Indies in Wellington). Both theses were phenomenal exhibitions of powerful batting. These innings along with many other quickfire knocks by other players highlight the path which the game of cricket is likely to follow with mammoth totals being  scored and chased thanks to power hitters and classical batsmen alike scoring at a faster rate."}, {"question": "All five test matches of Ashes 2015 were almost decided by the end of the second day's play with there being a clear indication of who would win. But the fourth test in particular was decided very quickly, by the end of the first session of the first day, thanks to one of the greatest spells of fast bowling in Ashes history. Who picked 8 wickets conceding only 15 runs and destroyed Austalia by bowling them out for just 60 runs in the first innings?", "context": "The Ashes is probably the most fiercely fought rivalry in cricket. Played between Australia and England on a two-year cycle, the 2015 Ashes series was played in England.Stuart Broad pioneered one of the most devastating first sessions in Ashes history as he picked up 8 wickets in just 9.3 overs to destroy Australia and bundle them out for just 60 runs in 18.3 overs. The first wicket he picked up was his 300th in test cricket. Joe Root then hit a masterclass century to all but confirm an England victory. Stuart Broad's figures of 8 for 15 were the best for an Australian bowler since the great Jim Laker's 9 for 37 and 10 for 53 way back in 1956.This was certainly a 'black' day for Australian cricket in Nottingham."}, {"question": "A new era began for Test Cricket on 27th November 2015 as the first Day-Night Test match was played between Australia and New Zealand using pink balls.

The first ever recognized test match was played between England and Australia in 1877. From this historic moment in Melbourne, the game has undergone considerable change. The most important change to date was probably the introduction of limited overs international matches in 1971 and the subsequent establishment of a World Cup ever four years from 1975.The other major adaptation was the introduction of coloured clothing in international ODI matches during the rebel Kerry Packer World Series which was later incorporated into the official ICC recognised matches. The introduction of day and night matches also happened during the same time. The second half of the match would be played under flood lights. This was probably the one major change that pulled large crowds to the stadiums even during the weekdays.Until 2016, only One Day International matches and Twenty 20 matches were played under lights. But the year 2016 saw the first ever Day-Night test match played between Australia and New Zealand in Adelaide.

Who was the unlucky opponent?", "context": "Quick runs and power hitting. This was the epitome of New Zealand's chase of 117 runs set by Sri Lanka in the second One Day International of the series in Christchurch.Sri Lanka were bowled out for just 117 runs in 27.4 overs thanks to good fast bowling by the New Zealand bowlers. In reply, the Kiwis mercilessly destroyed any bowler who bowled at them.

The match was over even before the scheduled lunch break. The game lasted just 36 overs.The record for the fastest ODI century held by South African AB de Viliiers was under threat for a while but Guptill ended up running short of runs remaining to be scored.

If the six tests were taken as one series, what were the stats for this series from South Africa's point of view?", "context": "South Africa won the games in Sydney and Johannesburg; Australia won the games in Adelaide and Cape Town; the games in Melbourne and Durban were drawn. They also played eight one-day internationals while in South Africa, and these were also tied at 4-4."}, {"question": " In June 1994, South Africa travelled to England for their first test series there since readmission. It was a three test series. After the first test at Lords, which two South Africans had their names added to the Honours Board?", "context": "Kepler hit 105 in the South Africa's first innings of 357 before being caught behind off the bowling of Gough. In England's reply, Allan Donald had figures of 5/74 as England crashed to 180 all out. Set 456 to win in the final innings, England were bowled out for just 99."}, {"question": " In June 1994, South Africa travelled to England for their first test series there since readmission. Having lost the third test to draw the series, South Africa then lost both one-day internationals. On the way back to SA, they stopped off at the Hague for an ODI against the Netherlands. What was the outcome of this match?", "context": "Quite possibly the low point of South African cricket since readmission. South Africa slumped to 52/6 with Jansen taking 3/8 before reaching 134 in their allotted 40 overs. In contrast, Clarke and Cantrell made 122 for Holland before they lost their first wicket and ironically it was part-time spinner Peter Kirsten who got the only wicket."}, {"question": " In November 1994 Mike Procter was sacked as coach of South Africa and the job was offered to Bob Woolmer. Where was Woolmer coaching at the time?", "context": "Although Bob Woolmer played his county cricket at Kent, and had spells at both Natal and Western Province and coached Boland, he was with  when he was offered the job of SA coach. It was at  that he first encountered Allan Donald. \r The appointment of Woolmer as coach almost coincided with Kepler Wessels' retirement and Hansie Cronj\u00e9 being made captain. This partnership was to last 4\u00ad\u00bd years and guided South Africa through one of their most successful periods in cricket history and will form the basis for my second quiz in this series.\r Thank you for playing my quiz - I hope you enjoyed playing it. Look out for the next one soon."}, {"question": "In January 1995, wicketkeeper Dave Richardson scored his maiden test century. This came against New Zealand in Cape Town. Who was at the crease with him when he reached 100 runs?", "context": "Clive Eksteen joined him just before tea on the third day and resolutely blocked everything that came his way, while Richardson steadily accumulated runs. The following morning, Eksteen was eventually bowled for 22 off 151 balls, by which stage Richardson had moved on to 87. A restrained  came to the crease, and stuck around long enough for Richardson to reach this milestone."}, {"question": "In winning the Newlands test against New Zealand, what record did South Africa achieve?", "context": "Having lost the opening test in Johannesburg, South Africa rallied to win in Durban and Cape Town, to become the first side to win a three match test series in the 20th Century, having gone 1-0 down. Centurion in the final test, Dave Richardson, was named Man of the Series."}, {"question": "In October 1995, South Africa played a one-off test in Harare against Zimbabwe. Allan Donald recorded his then best test score of 33, as well as his best test bowling figures. What were his figures?", "context": "He scored 33 from 49 balls including five 4s, before being bowled by Bryan Strang. He then took 3/42 in the first innings, and a phenomenal 8/71 in the second, as South Africa won by 7 wickets."}, {"question": "In the test in October 1995, who were the only batsmen whose wickets Donald failed to get in either innings?", "context": "Campbell was caught behind off Brett Schultz for a duck in the first innings, and then caught by Schultz off McMillan for 28 in the second. Bryan Strang was lbw to Schultz in the first, and not out in the second."}, {"question": "The end of 1995 saw the arrival of England for a 5 test series and seven one-day internationals. The first test at Centurion Park near Pretoria was washed out after the second day, but who made his test debut in this match?", "context": "Despite the game itself being a damp squib (literally), Pollock's debut certainly showed the future he would have as test bowler. He took 3/98 off 29 overs, picking up the wickets of Atherton, Thorpe, and Hick. Jacques Kallis made his debut in the third test of this series in Durban; Paul Adams made his debut in the fourth test at Port Elizabeth, and while Lance Klusener was to make his ODI debut against the English, he did not make his test debut until later on against India."}, {"question": "After two washed out tests and two draws, the series came down to the final test at Newlands. Having bowled England out for just 153, South Africa found themselves at 171/9 when Paul Adams joined Dave Richardson at the crease. How many runs did they add for the 10th wicket?", "context": "It was to remain the highest partnership of the match taking South Africa to a total of 244, and a position from where they could win the match. Richardson was 53 not out, while Adams scored 29. By far his best first class score at the time."}, {"question": "On the third day of the test, Hansie Cronj\u00e9 was fined by the match referee, for badgering the umpire into calling for a TV replay. Which batsman was on the receiving end of this change of decision?", "context": "Run out by Rhodes, who else.  With the availability of technology to view close decisions still rather new, Dave Orchard gave Thorpe \"in\" without referring. When the replay on the big screen clearly showed Thorpe to have been short of his ground, Hansie Cronj\u00e9 asked Umpire Orchard to refer the decision to the Third Umpire.After conferring with the other umpire, he indeed did so, and Thorpe was given out."}, {"question": "On the third day of the test, whose wicket did Paul Adams pick up in both innings?", "context": "was one of the few batsmen to offer resistance in this test, but was eventually bowled by Adams in the 1st innings for 66. In the second innings, he was caught behind off Adams for just 13 as England collapsed to 157 all out, leaving South Africa the paltry target of 67 to win the match and series. Ironically, Smith was himself born in South Africa."}, {"question": "By winning the test at Newlands, this was the first time South Africa had beaten England at home in how many years?", "context": "Not since the 1930/1 series had South Africa won a test series on home soil against the English. That series had also ended 1-0 with the first recording a victory for SA, and the remaining four were all drawn."}, {"question": " South Africa next travelled to the UAE to compete in the Sharjah Cup against India and Pakistan. Despite this being their first trip to Sharjah, they won all 4 round-robin matches and the final. Who was named Man of the Series?", "context": "scored a total of 356 runs at an average of 89 including two centuries, one of which being his 115 not out in the final. He also took six catches in the series which was more than any other player in the tournament, except South African wicketkeeper Dave Richardson."}, {"question": " The 1996 Cricket World Cup, held in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka: In their opening game, South Africa came up against the UAE. The game will be best remembered for Kirsten's 188* - the highest score in a World Cup at the time - but in another famous incident, one of the UAE batsmen came to the crease to face Allan Donald without wearing a helmet. Who was the batsman?", "context": "Emirates' captain Zarawani strode to the crease wearing only a turban on his head. Donald promptly felled him with a well directed bouncer first ball. Amazingly, he still did not call for a helmet, but he was mercifully dismissed 6 balls later when Cronj\u00e9 caught him at mid-off off the bowling of Brian McMillan."}, {"question": " In the process of breezing through the group stages, South Africa won their 10th consecutive one-day international. Who were their opponents?", "context": "Batting first SA amassed a huge total of 329. To their credit, Holland managed to bat out the 50 overs, but barely reached half SA's score."}, {"question": " Having won all their group matches, South Africa were favourites to take the cup. In the quarter-final they met the West Indies who only a few days earlier had been beaten by Kenya. Whose omission from the side by the selectors is generally considered to be the reason for South Africa's defeat?", "context": "Perhaps because he had gone for 50 in 8 overs against Pakistan, perhaps because they felt two spinners were necessary on that wicket, or perhaps because they didn't fear the West Indies after their defeat to Kenya, so they decided to rest him. Whatever the reason, the decision, in retrospect, was proven to be the wrong one as the wounded West Indian tiger, in the form of one Brian Charles Lara, decimated the South African bowling attack with a blistering 111. South Africa fell short in the chase by 19 runs and their World Cup dreams were over."}, {"question": " South Africa were to return to India later that year for the Titan Cup and a three test series. In the second test at Eden Gardens, Lance Klusener made his test debut for South Africa. Having been carted around the park by Azharuddin in the first innings, Klusener came back in the second to record what was to remain as his best figures in an innings. What was his return in this innings?", "context": "In the first innings, the debutant suffered at the hands of Mohammed Azharuddin with figures of 0/75 from 14 overs. He got his revenge in the 2nd innings picking up eight of the 10 wickets, including that of Azharuddin as India were dismissed for just 137 runs and the series was leveled. India went on to win the decisive third test and the series however."}, {"question": " Almost immediately after returning from India, the Indians travelled here for a further 3-test series. Which South African made his test debut in this series?", "context": "On the back of some good performances and with South Africa struggling in the middle order, , nephew of former SA captain and UCBSA MD, Dr Aaron (Ali) Bacher, was included in the squad. In the three matches, he contributed 141 runs at an average of 23,50.However, he was responsible for one of the most memorable moments of the series - a superb diving one-handed catch on the boundary to dismiss Sachin Tendulkar at Newlands."}, {"question": " The second test was most notable, for the fact that a total of five centuries were scored in the first innings of both sides. One of these by Lance Klusener, was the fast century by a South African at the time. In how many balls did he reach his century?", "context": "Batting at no.9, Klusener scored 102 runs not out off exactly  balls. His last 27 runs came from just 9 deliveries. Other centurions in the innings were Kirsten (103) & McMillan (103*) as South Africa scored a mammoth 529/7 decl. India responded with 359, with both Tendulkar (169) and Azharuddin (115) getting centuries themselves. South Africa went on to win the match by 282 runs, and take a 2-0 lead in the series."}, {"question": " There was one further notable incident in the second test and that was that South African wicketkeeper Dave Richardson claimed his first stumping in test cricket. Who was the unlucky batsman?", "context": "Despite having over 150 dismissals at test level, Prasad was to become Richardson's first test stumping five years after making his debut. Having been bowled by Paul Adams for a duck in the first innings, he was stumped off the same bowler for 15 in the second."}, {"question": " After India came Australia. In the first test at the Wanderers, South Africa won the toss and posted a respectable 302. With Australia at 191/4 at the close of play on day 2, SA were in a strong position, but the third day was to change that as two Australian batsmen batted through the entire day for only the 10th time in history. Who were the two batsmen?", "context": "Their partnership of 385 was the highest against South Africa and the 2nd highest ever for the 5th Wicket. Blewett went on to make 214 having been at the crease for 8 hours 39 minutes and Australia eventually declared their innings closed at 628/8. They then bowled South Africa out for a mere 130 to win by an innings and 196 runs."}, {"question": " In the second test at St Georges Park, Australia won the toss and put South Africa in on a 'green' wicket. How many runs were scored and how many wickets fell in the first two days?", "context": "At one stage South Africa were 95/7 as Gillespie & McGrath ripped through the top and middle order. Only a spirited 95 run partnership between Dave Richardson and Brian McMillan enabled South Africa to reach 209. However, they then turned around and gave as good as they got.At 10/1 overnight, Australia were bowled out for just 108. At the close of play, Kirsten and Bacher had put on 83 for a total of exactly 400 runs over two days' play. Australia though went on to bowl SA out for 168 and won the match by 2 wickets."}, {"question": " South Africa gained some consolation by winning the third test at Centurion. In this match, Allan Donald became only the second South African to take 150 test wickets. Who was his 150th victim?", "context": "Elliot was #148, Waugh #149 and Taylor #151. Donald took 8/96 and was named Man of the Match.

To my knowledge, none of the De Silvas who have played for SL are related. Muttiah Muralitharan has taken enough wickets for a whole family, but he is a one-off (in more ways than one)."}, {"question": "When Sri Lanka broke the Test innings run record, Sanath Jayasuriya scored 340. Who was the batsman that scored 225 and established a new Test partnership record with him?", "context": "Mahanama was a very under-rated player throughout his career.

He has played 102 Tests with a batting average of 55.78 and a bowling average of 31.71 and 231 ODIs with a batting and bowling average of 43.92 and 32.33 respectively, it is quite clear why Kallis is considered one of the best all-rounders to play/have played for South Africa.He is solid in defence and plays beautiful textbook shots.

Australian captain Ricky Pointing made 164 of just 105 balls to steer the Aussies, with the help of other quick fire innings to a massive total of 434, the highest ODI score at the time. South Africa had their backs to the wall and their only option was to come out blazing. Graeme Smith set the pace of the match by scoring 92 from just 60 odd balls.

He started to hit the Australian bowlers around the park.The game started to even out, with no team really on top of the game. Come the final over. Klusener gets a few runs and with 3 balls to go South Africa just needs one single run to win the game, as a tie would see Australia through to the final, due to the standings after the Super Six rounds. Lance played the ball past the bowler and started to walk forward. Donald interpreted this as a signal to run and started to dart down the end, yet Klusener had shouted no to the run, with Donald half way down the field and the Aussies with the ball in their possession the obvious happened, Donald was run out (the score on 213/9) and Australia was through to the final.

What happens to the ball in this delivery?", "context": "The Flipper gets squeezed out of the front of the hand with the thumb and first two fingers, as in a clicking movement.

Other than at the beginning of a match, the ball normally has one side which is rougher than the other. Which side of the ball should the rough side be facing to achieve this type of delivery?", "context": "The ball should be held with the seam being held by the thumb, at the bottom of the ball, and by the first two fingers (slightly angled) at the top, so that the seam is slightly pointing into the leg side of the batsman (towards the right).\r To aid the swing of the ball, the arm used to deliver the ball should be as near vertical as can be and the arm holding the ball, should brush close to the ear."}, {"question": "Having succeeded in bowling the in-swinger, you decide to have a go at the out-swinger - Which direction should the rough side be facing to achieve this delivery?", "context": "Very similar in nature to the in-swinger except that the rough side is on the opposite side and the seam is pointing slightly to the left.\r Out-swingers are considered to be one of the more difficult deliveries to face for a right-handed batsman, especially if performed by a fast paced bowler, as the ball will move away from the batsman's body and any mistake by the batsman could result in an outside edge being made which could go to the wicket-keeper, or to any one of the slip fielders."}, {"question": "On hearing about the leg-cutter you decide to give this a go - What type of bowler performs this delivery?", "context": "A fast bowler will usually hold the ball with the wrist locked in position, and the thumb and middle finger holding the seam. The first finger will be placed about two centimeters away from the middle finger.\r With the seam vertical, the two fingers are worked down the left side of the ball at the point of release, effectively imparting spin on the ball, making the ball deviate ('cut') to the left on pitching, which is how the delivery is so named.\r The delivery can also be used with very little variation, to produce a slower delivery and makes it doubly deceptive."}, {"question": "The famed off-spin bowler, Saqlain Mushtaq, has been recognised with inventing a particular delivery which has also been called the 'wrong one' - What is the more familiar name of this delivery?", "context": "The word  means \"(the) second (one)\" or \"(the) other (one)\" in Urdu, and gained recognition in the 1990's as Saqlain Mustaq began to include this in his arsenal, and followed by other bowlers such as Shoaib Malik, Muttiah Muralitharan and Johan Botha.\r The ball is pitched either in line of the stumps (around the off-stump usually) or just outside and turns away from the right-handed batsman. This is the reverse of the off-break delivery (where it turns towards the batsman) and thus is the reason why the  is often called the 'wrong one'.\r The delivery has effectively reignited the dying embers of off-spin bowling to such an extent that it has now become one of the most feared deliveries in the off-spinner's arsenal."}, {"question": " Later in the game when the ball is quite worn and in excess of 40 overs old, a distinct phenomenon will happen to it when fast bowlers manage to deliver the ball over 80 m.p.h.- what effect is this known as?", "context": "Due to the wear and tear of a cricket ball as it 'ages' during a match, it will begin to move quite late in the delivery in the opposite direction to where it would normally swing, without the bowler having to make any significant alterations to his grip on the ball.\r Therefore it is possible for an in-swinging delivery to swing in first before moving back outwards as it passes the batsman. As it occurs late in the delivery it makes it difficult for the batsman to judge the changes whilst the ball is in the air.\r A simplistic explanation (taken from Wikipedia) of what occurs is taken from the former England bowling coach Troy Cooley:\r \"Reverse swing is all to do with the deterioration of the ball and the seam position in flight. As the ball becomes rougher, it will take on a different characteristic as it deteriorates. So if you present the ball as an out-swinger, the ball has deteriorated so much on the rough side that it takes on the characteristics of the shiny side. Which means a natural out-swinger will become an in-swinger and conversely, an in-swinger into an out-swinger.\""}, {"question": "Graham Gooch scored 333 against India in 1990, but who dropped him before he reached 50?", "context": "Gooch never gave another chance after that one, and went on to beat Don Bradman's test record at Lords'."}, {"question": "Warwickshire won the 1993 NatWest Trophy at Lords' in dramatic style.

The \"wickets\" are also known as \"the stumps\". The whole assembly must be a standard 9 inches wide.\r Traditionally, the \"wicket\" was made from a \"wicket\" gate - and therefore could be any width. This obviously led to all sorts of shenanigans as sides attempted to gain an advantage by choosing wider or narrower \"wickets\". Eventually, people settled on two stumps, but again, there was no standard width - so again, there could be all sorts of problems arising from this. Once these were standardized at 5 inches width (with one bail sitting on top of the two stumps), batsmen soon found that they could guard their wickets either by putting their leg in front of them, or by choosing to have a very wide bat made for themselves.\r As a batsman myself, I think this was all very fair, of course! Eventually, in 1774, standard laws were drawn up for the game, which increased the number of stumps to three, with two bails across them. At the same time, the LBW (Leg Before Wicket) Law was bought in, to stop batsmen indiscriminately covering the wicket with their legs, and another Law was brought in limiting the width of the bat. These laws have stayed in placed fundamentally unchanged since that time, thus ensuring an equal contest between batsman and bowler."}, {"question": "Where, and in what year of the 18th century, is the earliest evidence of cricket being played in the USA?", "context": "William Stephens was a planter, living in Georgia, having received his education at Winchester College and then Cambridge University before moving to the USA.

After the revolution, when the question of giving a title to the Chief Executive Officer of the United States was being discussed, John Adams is reported as saying \"There are Presidents of fire companies and cricket clubs\". Therefore, the role of cricket in the United States may well be a lot more significant than many of us think.\r These days, there are a number of flourishing leagues throughout the USA. As well as being popular along the East coast, both the California State Leagues and the Texan State leagues are extremely popular, with almost 100 clubs playing in a number of highly competitive leagues throughout Texas."}, {"question": "From what object do historians believe that the game of cricket inherited its name?", "context": "Randle Cotgrave's French-English Dictionary, published in 1611, describes the word \"crosse\" as follows - \"a cricket staffe, or a  wherein boyes play at cricket\".\r This would make perfect sense, as pictorial evidence of the earliest cricket bats show them to be precisely that - a rather thick staff, which is curved at one end. A lot more similar to a modern hockey stick or golf club - or indeed to a Gaelic hurling stick, which is believed to have its origins in prehistoric times. It is likely that the design of the cricket bat changed to the straighter bat that we know today sometime toward the end of the 18th century, at around the time when bowling \"grubber\" balls (which shot along the ground) was outlawed."}, {"question": "Who is attributed with first employing roundarm bowling?", "context": "John Willes (1777-1852) was an early cricket enthusiast. He played in the first Gentlemen v Players match in 1806, built his own indoor practice arena, and employed his own cricket coach. However, it was his sister who first bowled with a roundarm action to him. Legend has it - though intuition would tend to back this up - that she had problems bowling underarm because of her voluminous skirts. Therefore it was physically easier for her to bowl with a roundarm action. So impressed was Willes with the trajectory of the ball that he tried the action out whilst playing for Kent versus the MCC at Lord's. The umpire promptly called \"no ball\" at Willes' first roundarm attempt. Willes was outraged, jumped on to his horse, and apparently would have nothing to do with cricket ever again.\r Roundarm bowling caught on though, and in due course, it was passed into the Laws of the game as a legitimate method of delivering the ball."}, {"question": "The first international cricket match between two nations was played in 1844.

The home team weren't expecting them, and as such, had no side ready to play against the New York side. A team was hastily assembled, and a good time was had by all - so much so, that the Americans invited the Canadians to play an international match back in New York a few years later. And hence North America has yet another very important piece of cricket history for which it can take credit.\r For what its worth, that first ever match was won by Canada by 23 runs.

The journey took six days, and all of the side were violently sea sick for the duration of the crossing.\r They also travelled back to Australia without their only recognized wicketkeeper, Ted Pooley. He had been detained in New Zealand after a bar room fracas. Therefore England had to press John Selby into emergency wicketkeeping duties. England were expecting to play a Victorian side, but when they turned up in Melbourne, they found that they were playing a representative side calling themselves \"Australia\". The match started within hours of the bedraggled squad landing back in Australia, and the host team duly won the game by 45 runs.

Bush once stated, \"I'm a cricket match person.\" He was, of course joking, and laughter followed his comment.  However in 1859, which future American president attended an American cricket match between Chicago and Milwaukee?", "context": "Did the American civil war contribute to the decline of cricket in America? Some have speculated that this is the case.  However, as we shall see, there were other more important factors at work.  I do think that if the history of the sport were better known, if it were more commonly appreciated that interest and involvement in cricket preceded that in American football, baseball and basketball, at least some Americans would more readily consider cultivating an interest in the sport."}, {"question": "Even as cricket's star rose and waxed over American soil, the seeds of its demise were sown.  And just as the metaphors of this author mix in the sentence preceding, so too there were a mixture of reasons held to contribute to the demise of this glorious sport in our country.  Which of the following factors cannot be held to have contributed to the decline of American interest and participation in cricket?", "context": "How, you may well wonder, could the American Revolution have contributed to the demise of American cricket? In the late 1800s the Imperial Cricket Conference came into being, limiting its members to teams residing within the British Commonwealth.  Little did our forefathers realize that the cost of their rebellion would include our country's exclusion from the most important emerging international professional cricket organization.  If this were not enough, the well-heeled practitioners and spectators that most supported the sport became increasingly alienated from the urban masses, the latter becoming increasing enamored with baseball.As the popularity of the latter skyrocketed and Americans remained effectively excluded from the international game, American cricket began its grim and inglorious downward slide.  Is it possible we are becoming ready to reclaim our heritage with respect to this noble game?"}, {"question": "Baseball and cricket coexisted for many years, and some athletes were involved in both sports.

By what year could cricket be said to have \"virtually disappeared from the American sporting landscape\"?", "context": "According to an article aptly appearing in a publication named \"The Hard News Caf\u00e9\", by , cricket had died its inglorious death in America.  Cricket, despite its early American roots, had become the property of the British Empire.

Who can forgive or forget Robin William's likening cricket to \"baseball played on Valium \".But lest you be tempted to draw a kindly veil over this quiz and go on to another, I will tell you that the final three questions of this until now sad tale deal with the revival of cricket in the land of the free."}, {"question": "Happily, cricket is reviving in America.  A 2006 estimate indicated that there were over 700 clubs and over 50,000 players nationwide.  Of course, this has come about in typical American fashion.

Where did the United States place?", "context": "OK, so the US team won this tournament by a mere net run rate of 0.028 of a run.  It is probably even more significant that US teams are again appearing in international competitions.  The United States of America Cricket Association actively supports not only international efforts but also a variety of programs within the United States including programs to involve increasing numbers of youth."}, {"question": " American involvement in real football (also known as soccer) has steadily increased, in part fueled by involvement at the college level.  At which of the following universities can cricket clubs now be found?", "context": "Two prevalent myths have long impeded the progress of cricket in the USA: the game is too slow, and cricket is too complicated.  I personally resent both the assertion that Americans are somehow unable to appreciate the subtleties that account for the games spectator appeal and the allegation that Americans are not intellectually equipped to understand even the basics of the game.The fact of there being a cricket ground at the University of Texas in Dallas underscores the pervasiveness of cricket at American universities.Although the numbers involved in the sport remain comparatively small, this was once equally true of football (soccer).  With American interest in cricket on the rise at both the professional and college level, the continued expansion of this sport can be expected to accelerate as was the case with football (soccer) in the late 20th century.

He changed the five-day format to a single day or day-night event, introduced a white ball, and bright uniforms to replace the cream flannels worn in the traditional version of the sport.

In the 50 overs version of the game, each bowler can bowl a maximum of 10 overs. Of course, there is no restriction on the number of bowlers that can be used, the only restriction is on the maximum number of overs.In test cricket there is no restriction on number of overs that can be bowled by a bowler."}, {"question": "A new concept in T-20 cricket is that of the football style bowl-out. When is a bowl-out resorted to?", "context": "The bowl-out is a new football style concept. This is applicable whenever the match ends in a tie (scores level). In this case, five bowlers from each of side bowl in turns at the stumps; whoever hits the stumps (bowled) gets one point. The team getting the most points is declared the winner.The first bowl out in the history of T-20 cricket happened in the First T-20 World cup in South Africa in the match between India and Pakistan. India won the bowl out by a margin of 3-0.  Bowl-out is not used in the 50 overs version of the game or in test cricket. If scores are level, the match will be called as a tie."}, {"question": "Another new concept of T-20 cricket is the free-hit, wherein a batsman gets a chance to have a free hit at the ball knowing that he cannot be given out. When does the free-hit come into play?", "context": "Whenever a bowler bowls a no ball, a penalty of one run is awarded to the batting side and the batsman gets an extra delivery. However, in T-20 cricket apart from this penalty, a free hit is given in the next delivery. So if no-ball occurs, then the next ball is a free hit for the batsman, he can play any stroke and will not be given out (except run out).\r Though this rule is loaded in favour of the batsman, in the opinion of great bowlers like Ian Bishop, this rule has helped bowlers to be more disciplined and control the number of no-balls. After the success of this rule in T-20 cricket, it has been extended to the 50 overs version. However, there is no free hit in test cricket."}, {"question": "The powerplay is the fielding restrictions in a one day match, when not more than 2 fielders are allowed outside the 30 yard circle. In a T-20 match, how many overs of powerplay is allowed?", "context": "Powerplay refers to the fielding restrictions in place during the start of the match. This is done to allow batsman to have a go at the bowlers and make the match more interesting. During the fielding restrictions, only 2 players are allowed outside the 30 yard circle and of the remaining players 2 (excluding the wicket keeper) have to be in a catching position.This opens up gaps in the field allowing the batsman to get quick runs.  In T-20 matches, the powerplay is one for  overs. In 50 overs match, it is for 20 overs (10 fixed + 2 blocks of 5 overs used at the fielding side's discretion).There is no powerplay concept in test cricket."}, {"question": "A bowler bowls a fast full toss (beamer) at the batsman which misses his head, this is immediately called as a no-ball by the umpire. The batsman gets a free hit the next delivery.", "context": "The free hit is allowed only for a foot fault no ball, i.e. if the bowler oversteps his mark while bowling. If the no ball results from bowling a beamer or more than the permitted number of bouncers or for violating fielding restrictions, then the no ball will result in a penalty run and one extra ball, but the free hit is not allowed.This rule is applicable for both T-20 and 50 overs matches.

In test matches a minimum of ninety overs needs to be bowled in one day (six hours of play + permitted extra time)."}, {"question": "In T-20 cricket, how many bouncers are allowed in any over?", "context": "In both T-20, a bowler can bowl only one bouncer per over. A bouncer is defined as a fast delivery that goes above shoulder height of the batsman. If the bowler bowls a second bouncer, it is called a no ball. In test cricket and ODIs, a bowler can bowl two bouncers per over."}, {"question": "How many drink breaks are allowed in a T-20 innings?", "context": "No drinks breaks are allowed in a T-2 innings. This is because the objective is to finish the match as quickly as possible, with minimum breaks. There will only one break allowed, which will be in between innings which would be generally between 15-2 minutes.In 5 overs cricket, there would be two drinks break per innings. In test cricket, there would be a drinks break after every hour of play."}, {"question": "Why do batsmen in T-20 matches sit close to the boundary, instead of sitting in the dressing room?", "context": "In test and 50 overs cricket, the two teams sit in the dressing room; but in T-20 cricket keeping in mind the time limitation, both teams sit in a baseball style dugout outside the boundary. In fact, on fall of a wicket the incoming batsman has to take guard within 1 minutes 30 seconds of the fall of wicket, failing which he will be declared timed out.In the 50 overs ODI and test cricket, a batsman can be timed out if he is not ready to take guard within 3 minutes of the fall of the previous wicket."}, {"question": " In T-20 cricket, a batsman is not allowed to bat after scoring a century.

In 1936, the club bought a parcel of land in Ilovo where they originally established a golf course called Kent Park. The stadium was later built adjacent to the golf course. Stadiums are often given names designating each end in reference to external features, and the two ends of the Wanderers are called the Golf Course End and the Corlett Drive End.

His appetite for runs was astonishing as was his longevity in the game. Whilst his first class career boasted a staggering 61,760 runs, during which he compiled 199 centuries, he scored 5,410 runs in 61 Tests at an average a fraction below 57. This places him amongst the elite and, to boot, he was also a gifted fieldsman at cover point.\r The choice for the second opener, literally, fell to a toss of the coin. It was difficult to separate between Alastair Cook and Leonard Hutton. By the time that he'd retired, Cook had amassed more Test runs than any other Englishman. A composed and patient batsman he would definitely have been a worthy opener in this line-up. Len Hutton revealed his greatness very early. He compiled a century in his second Test match and then, in his sixth Test, scored 364 which became the highest individual Test score until it was overtaken in 1958. Like Hobbs, he retired from Test cricket with an average a shade under 57 and scored 6,971 runs over the course of 79 Tests. What is remarkable about Hutton is that he badly broke his arm during World War II. The damage was so severe that he was forced to re-adjust his technique and use a shorter handled bat upon his return to cricket."}, {"question": "Which of the following nicknames is best associated with West Indies batsman Vivian Richards?", "context": "Better known as Viv, Richards was also known by the nicknames The Emperor and Smokin' Joe.

Add to that being listed as one of the five Greatest Cricketers of the 20th Century by a panel of 100 experts. In 121 Test matches, he scored in excess of 8,500 runs at an average of 50.23 but statistics do not do his batting justice. Viv walked to the crease with a swagger that many mistook for arrogance and it is fair to say that every West Indian cricketer felt ten feet taller when Sir Viv graced the field. Richards never wore a helmet during his career despite the fact that the late 1970s and the early 1980s were blessed with a series of extremely quick bowlers. Michael Holding, a highly respected bowler, commentator and teammate of Viv summed up best; \"He never looked intimidated. Richard Hadlee in New Zealand, Dennis Lillee in Australia, Abdul Qadir in Pakistan, Bishen Bedi in India. Ian Botham in England.

In 234 first class games he accumulated 28,067 runs at a staggering rate of 95.14 per dismissal."}, {"question": "Which one of the following was not one of the famous \"Three W's\" from the West Indies teams of the 1950s?", "context": ", affectionately known as \"Plum\", who, ironically was also born in the West Indies, played 15 Tests for England after debuting in 1899 and was captain of the side in ten of those matches.\r The \"Three W's\" were one of the greatest gifts that the game of cricket received and, remarkably, all three were born in St. Michael's Parish in Barbados, delivered by the same mid-wife, in the space of two years.\r The first of the three is Frank Worrell. He doesn't make the final eleven but I have given him the task of being this team's manager. This decision is based purely upon the success he achieved as captain of the West Indies team during the 1960s and respect that he'd earned during that period. Worrell became the first \"permanent\" black captain of the West Indies cricket team. It should be noted that this elevation came at a time when a \"White Australia\" policy was still in existence that prevented coloured people immigrating to the land \"down under\", at a time when the Maori Affairs Amendment Act in New Zealand was still years away from being enacted, at a time when South Africa was still refusing to play Tests against the West Indies because of the coloured players in their line-up and, at a time that Enoch Powell still hadn't delivered his racist \"Rivers of Blood\" speech. Despite all this Worrell guided his team through the 1960 series against Australia with such aplomb that nearly one quarter of Australia's population lined the streets of Melbourne for a parade to honour them. All future contests since, between these two nations, have been contested for the Sir Frank Worrell Trophy.\r Of Everton Weekes, Richie Benaud once said, that when Weekes came out to bat he had but one intention - \"to hammer the bowlers\". One of the hardest hitters that the game has seen Weekes only ever hit one six out of the ground in his Test career because, he claimed, there was a danger of breaking too many windows. His stats will show two sixes but his recollection was that the second was the result of overthrows. In his 48 Test match career he accumulated in excess of 4,500 runs at the amazing average of 58.61. In that total were 15 Test hundreds, five of which came in successive innings against a powerful Australian bowling attack. Remarkably, he was dismissed for 90 attempting the sixth.\r Clyde Walcott (although he was never knighted) is the gloveman for this line-up. Clyde was a wicketkeeper/batsman during his first 15 Tests for his country. In this role he had a Test batting average slightly over 40, which is an indication that he could have, potentially, been ranked amongst the greatest here. However, once he relinquished the gloves and played purely as a specialist batsman, his average rose to a whopping 64. His combination of power and grace once led to respected cricket writer, David Firth, describing his batting as \"an unforgettable mix of silk and gently rolling thunder\"."}, {"question": "Which of the following was the first cricketer to have played 100 Test matches?", "context": "When I was still a young lad and, as a parochial Australian, I found it difficult to accept the fact that any English (Pommy) cricketer could be any good at all. That was until I saw  in action. The style and the elegance of the man left me in awe. He possessed that delicious ability to bisect the area between cover and point with effortless grace. And then there was the heroism when he answered England's distress call during the 1974-75 Ashes series. Into his forties, he put his younger teammates to shame as he faced up to the ferociousness and brutality of the Australian bowling line-up led by Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson.\r In all Cowdrey played 114 Tests for his country and scored over 7,600 runs and took 120 catches.

Sobers, as a bowler, was equally adept at firing his fast medium missiles at the batsmen with the new ball as he was endeavouring to ply them out with his wily chinaman deliveries.He was a brilliant outfielder and scarily uncanny with his reflexive speed when fielding in close. As a batsman, he was exceptional.He compiled an unbeaten 365 in a Test against Pakistan in 1958, which remained as the highest individual Test score for almost 36 years and he ended his Test career after scoring in excess of 8,000 runs at an average of almost 58.

Hadlee possessed a wiry frame into which was embedded extraordinary power. It was little wonder because, for almost all of the 1980s, he carried the weight of a nation on his shoulders.He bowled with unerring accuracy and his ability to constantly keep the seam of the ball upright allowed him to get great deviation of the pitch. He took five wickets in an innings on a staggering 32 occasions and ended his Test career with a total of 431 wickets.He was also a more than handy batsman in the lower order, posting two Test centuries and passing fifty on fifteen other occasions."}, {"question": "Which of the following bowlers almost killed Australian batsman Peter Toohey, during a Test match at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad & Tobago in 1977?", "context": "In his autobiography the great West Indian batsman, Viv Richards, describes a list of batsmen who'd been struck and injured by . The list is extensive and reads like a brutal piece of war correspondence. Roberts was the first in an assembly line of great fast bowlers that evolved from the Caribbean Islands during the 1970s and 1980s. He loved the efficacy of the short pitched delivery and, while it was, at times, designed to hit the batsman, it wasn't to injure but to hasten their road to the surrender of their wicket.\r Whilst Roberts was blessed with raw speed it was his plotting mind that remained his secret weapon on the field. Michael Holding, one of his bowling partners, attested to the fact that Roberts was the master of working out the demise of a batsman and that he (himself) learned so much of his own craft from Roberts' advice. In his armoury Roberts had, what could be defined as, a \"lesser\" bouncer, which lulled batsmen into a false sense of security. Peter Toohey was one of those who, during the Australian tour of the West Indies in the 1977/78 season took advantage of one of these \"lesser\" bouncers and pulled it to the boundary for four. In his next over Roberts let fly a similar delivery, only yards quicker. Before Toohey realised what was happening he was struck between his forehead and the bridge of his nose. Newspapers, the following morning, showed photographs of a prone Peter Toohey being cradled by Viv Richards as he made desperate gestures to the change-rooms for assistance."}, {"question": "In 1993 Curtly Ambrose took seven wickets during a spell in a Test match in Perth for the cost of one run.", "context": "There were a wealth of fast bowlers that could easily have slotted into this line up but Curtly scores a place in the team because, as illustrated above, he is a match winner. Born in Antigua and standing at six feet seven inches (2.01 metres) Curtly was able to extra greater bounce from fuller lengths. He supplemented this gift by bowling with great accuracy and conceding few runs.\r In that 1993 Test, the West Indies were a side that was regrouping after the loss of some of their stars. Australia, on the other hand, was a team on the rise. Inciting memories of the highly regarded 1960-61 series between the countries, this series had been hard fought and was locked at one win apiece when the two sides met in Perth for the final Test. In, what was a winner-take-all scenario, Australia went to lunch on the first day with a respectable scoreline of two wickets down for 85 runs. Extracting steepling bounce from the pitch Ambrose went on a rampage after the break, removing seven Australian batsmen for a single run in the space of 32 deliveries. Australia was dismissed for 119, lost the Test and the series. Ambrose completed the match with nine wickets to his name and 33 wickets for the series.

By the time he was 23 years old he'd taken 100 Test wickets and, two years later, became the third fastest bowler to take 200 Test wickets. His importance to the side doubles when you add eight (of an eventual fourteen) Test centuries to that total. Botham was a significant weapon and a vital cog in the English cricket machine of the late 1970s and all of the 1980s.

The Sri Lankans appealed confidently but umpire Rudi Koertzen gave Gilchrist \"not out\". Gilchrist, who later admitted he knew full well he was out, simply turned and walked back to the pavilion.His action became the focus of much heated discussion. Rather than be praised for his gutsy sportsmanship, he was ridiculed and criticised by players, sportswriters and commentators.Despite the incidents that have been recorded in this quiz, cricket has managed to retain the reputation of a fair game with fair play.

It took eight more years for someone to equal this record.\rOn 2nd November 2014, Misbah-ul-Haq of Pakistan scored another 56-ball century against Australia in a test match at Abu Dhabi."}, {"question": "Balls were smacked to all parts of the ground on 13th November 2014 when Rohit Sharma of India, who scored 264 runs, outscored the entire Sri Lankan team who managed just 251 runs in an ODI. Needless to say, he comfortably broke the previous world record for the highest runs by a batsman in an ODI match by 45 runs. Where did this monumental act take place?", "context": "264 was and might still be considered as a very good team total in a One Day International cricket match. But these many runs were scored by one individual on 13th November 2014 against Sri Lanka when Rohit Sharma of India became the first player to have scored two ODI double centuries. He also shattered the previous record for the highest individual score in a One Day International game (219 runs by Virender Sehwag (India) vs West Indies at Indore on 8th Decembe 2011).\r India scored a massive 404 runs of which 264 were scored by Sharma.

Dhoni announced his retirement from test cricket on the penultimate day of 2014, as soon as the Boxing Day Test match was over in Melbourne. This was totally unexpected as there was still a match to be played in the series between India and Australia in Sydney. Who then was appointed captain for the last test match?", "context": "Mahendra Singh Dhoni retired from test cricket quite unexpectedly. He had played only 90 test matches and ended his career as the most successful Indian test captain. He captained India in 60 test matches with India winning 27 of these and India losing only 18.\r  took over the captaincy for the fourth test match of the India-Australia series at Sydney.

Two other batsmen scored centuries in the same innings. Who were these batsmen whose knocks were overshadowed by the ABD masterpiece?", "context": "Abraham Benjamin de Villiers, popularly known as just 'ABD' or 'Mr. 360', is probably one of the greatest cricketers South Africa has ever produced along with Jacques Kallis, Shaun Pollock, Greame Pollock and Allan Donald. ABD is one of the most versatile batsman the game has ever seen. \r In this particular knock, de Villiers arrived at the crease in the 39th over with the score being 247 and Hashim Amla at the other end already having scored a century. But de Villiers outscored Amla and scored the fastest century the game has ever seen in just 31 balls. When he got out in the last over, South Africa's score was 439 with de Villiers himself having scored 149 in just 59 balls.\r The previous record was a century off 36 balls by Corey Anderson (New Zealand), set in January 2014 vs. West Indies."}, {"question": "Eden Park, Auckland was the stage for one of the most thrilling finishes to an ODI match ever in World Cups. Co-hosts of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, New Zealand and Australia, played out a closely fought match with New Zealand emerging victorious with a one-wicket-win. Who hit the winning runs (a six) for New Zealand with nine wickets down?", "context": "This group stage match between Australia and New Zealand played at Eden Park, Auckland was one of the best matches of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015. Australia won the all important toss and  chose to bat first. They were cruising along at 80 for 1 before being reduced to 95 for 4. Trent Boult then bowled one of the best spells of fast bowling in World Cup history to rip apart the Australian lower middle order and the tail to bowl out Australia for 151 runs. Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin was the sole face of resistance scoring 43 runs.\r Chasing 152 runs to win, Brendon McCullum began with a blitzkrieg scoring 50 runs in just 24 balls before getting out. The score read 78 for 2. Mitchell Starc, eventual man of the tournament, then bowled probably an even greater spell than that bowled by Boult. Starc picked six wickets which included ripping apart the stumps four times. The equation was brought down to six runs required with only one wicket in hand for the Kiwis. Trent Boult blocked two fast threatening yorkers from Mitchell Starc and passed on the strike to  who smashed a six off Pat Cummins to end the memorable match."}, {"question": "England vs. Bangladesh was one of the most historic matches of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 with Bangladesh defeating England and in the process ensuring a place in the Quarter Finals for the first time ever; and also knocking England out. Which Bangladeshi batsman scored a century and was responsible for the formidable Bangladesh score?", "context": "This match of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 was played in Adelaide.England won the toss and put Bangladesh in to bat.

Bangladesh then strangled them with some very good death over bowling to bundle them out for 260 runs for a very famous win."}, {"question": "Pakistan and Australia met in the third quarter final of the ICC Cricket World Cup at Adelaide. One of the most exciting phases of the match was Wahab Riaz's fiery spell of fast bowling to Shane Watson which almost resulted in Watson getting out but for a dropped catch. Who dropped this important catch which could have turned the match and possibly knocked eventual champions Australia out of the tournament?", "context": "\"Pakistan: 212 allout in 49.5 overs. Australia chase down the total with more than 16 overs left and with 6 wickets in hand.\"\r This was the end result of the third quarter final of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015. But hidden behind these lines is a story of a fast bowler bowling his very best and capturing the imagination of millions around the world. Pakistani fast bowler Wahab Riaz ended with figures of 2 for 54 in 9 overs which is not that good in a low-scoring game of cricket. But for a period of about 30-45 minutes it looked like he would take the game away from Australia.\r He first got the dangerous David Warner out and then Michael Clarke with a clever bouncer. This brought all-rounder Shane Watson on to the pitch. He was welcomed by a fast bouncer by Riaz warning him of what was coming in the next few overs. What followed was total domination of the batsman by the bowler. Every ball that followed was fast and shoulder level or above with occassional full pitched deliveries. Watson was jumping around fending balls away, bending to save his head, hooking balls he normally wouldn't have. He was in a total mess. And Riaz sensing this started provoking Watson after every ball to make him lose his concentration. \r All this resulted in Watson hooking a fast bouncer directly to the fielder at fine-leg only for it to be dropped by . A great spell of fast bowling rendered useless by that dropped catch. Australia were then at 79 for 3 and that wicket would have made the game tight and who knows what might have happened. But as the history books will say, Australia won that match and eventually the tournament. What they won't say is the story of a fast bowler bowling his hearts out only to be denied by fate."}, {"question": "Two double centuries were scored in ODI cricket in the year 2015 and both by opening batsmen. Who scored them?", "context": "A decade ago, scoring a double ton in a One Day International match was unthinkable. But the advent of Twenty 20 cricket resulted in alternate batting styles with batsman playing more aggressively and scoring runs at a faster rate. The boundary lines no longer matter as balls are smashed out of the grounds for massive sixes. Fielding placements are immaterial as batsmen tend to find the gaps in more innovative ways. All in all, the level of batting has certainly increased by a few rungs.\r The year 2010 was a landmark year when Sachin Tendulkar scored the first ever double century in ODIs. Virender Sehwag and Rohit Sharma followed soon with 200s. Then came Rohit Sharma's mammoth 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014. All these were scored in batting-friendly conditions in India.\r The ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 saw mammoth scores by teams with 400 being breached multiple times. But two individual batting performances that stood out were the double centuries by Chris Gayle (215 against Zimbabwe in Canberra) and Martin Guptill (237 not out against West Indies in Wellington). Both theses were phenomenal exhibitions of powerful batting. These innings along with many other quickfire knocks by other players highlight the path which the game of cricket is likely to follow with mammoth totals being  scored and chased thanks to power hitters and classical batsmen alike scoring at a faster rate."}, {"question": "All five test matches of Ashes 2015 were almost decided by the end of the second day's play with there being a clear indication of who would win. But the fourth test in particular was decided very quickly, by the end of the first session of the first day, thanks to one of the greatest spells of fast bowling in Ashes history. Who picked 8 wickets conceding only 15 runs and destroyed Austalia by bowling them out for just 60 runs in the first innings?", "context": "The Ashes is probably the most fiercely fought rivalry in cricket.

The match lasted only three days but was a thriller with Australia winning by three wickets.

The first ever recognized test match was played between England and Australia in 1877. From this historic moment in Melbourne, the game has undergone considerable change. The most important change to date was probably the introduction of limited overs international matches in 1971 and the subsequent establishment of a World Cup ever four years from 1975.\r The other major adaptation was the introduction of coloured clothing in international ODI matches during the rebel Kerry Packer World Series which was later incorporated into the official ICC recognised matches. The introduction of day and night matches also happened during the same time. The second half of the match would be played under flood lights. This was probably the one major change that pulled large crowds to the stadiums even during the weekdays. \r Until 2016, only One Day International matches and Twenty 20 matches were played under lights. But the year 2016 saw the first ever Day-Night test match played between Australia and New Zealand in Adelaide.
